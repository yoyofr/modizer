* Refine the MOS 6581 filter model / parameters. Build an accurate MOS
  8580 filter model.

* Expose an interface for tunable filter parameters.

* Write documentation. Possibly a paper describing how SID was reverse
  engineered.

* Implement a SID tune player. A PSID player, VSID, is partly
  implemented in VICE.
