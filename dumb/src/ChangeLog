	now supported. Argh! I never want to program that again. :P

2001-09-09 14:25  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/render.c: 8-bit bug fixed, but the code
	hasn't been tested yet.

2001-09-09 13:07  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/play.c, src/render.c: Rendering and audio
	stream playing are now separated into levels.  The rendering level
	is available in dumb.h.  I've removed Bob's changes, so I hope it
	won't set him back too much :)

2001-09-08 20:23  joe_programmer

	* src/play.c: Slight change to make winamp plugin easier to write
	:)

2001-09-07 23:38  entheh

	* include/dintern.h, src/llload.c, tools/cit.c: The length of a DUH
	file is now stored, in preparation for Winamp and/or looping
	support.

2001-09-05 19:16  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Panning bug fixed. Forgot default sample panning!
	D'oh! :)

2001-09-05 17:37  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Volume envelopes working properly now, and stereo
	panning bug fixed.

2001-09-05 11:10  entheh

	* src/play.c, tools/cit.c: Volume envelopes... bleargh, zasx.duh
	sounds pretty good now :)

2001-09-04 21:12  entheh

	* make/: makefile.dj, makefile.lst: Makefile update (untested)

2001-09-04 19:46  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Portamento in the volume column is done, and
	handling of 'Compatible Gxx' is in place.

2001-09-04 12:56  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Pitch/Pan Separation is done.

2001-09-03 09:24  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/combine.c, src/main.c, src/sterpan.c,
	tools/cit.c: Stereo sound now works, finally! Not all stereo stuff
	is implemented though, and it'll suffer from the same bug as the
	volume (see the citbugs.txt file).

2001-09-02 19:34  entheh

	* examples/playduh.c, include/dumb.h, src/combine.c, src/getsig.c,
	src/main.c, src/play.c, src/sample.c, src/sequence.c: COMB signal
	implemented. This will allow two mono signals to be combined into a
	stereo one. SPAN (panning), and modifications to cit.c, still to do
	before any stereo sound will be heard.

2001-08-24 19:01  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/getsig.c, src/play.c, src/resample.c,
	src/sample.c, src/sequence.c: Support for multiple channels has
	been added. Adding stereo sound support should be a breeze now, but
	that'll have to wait for another day.

2001-08-24 14:17  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, tools/cit.c, tools/citbugs.txt: Dunno what this
	commit is, but it seems it should've been done a long time ago :)

2001-08-17 18:25  entheh

	* docs/duhspecs.txt, src/sequence.c, tools/cit.c: A new compression
	system is in use for the sequences. WARNING: OLDER DUH FILES WILL
	CAUSE A CRASH. This is the price you pay for using a version of
	DUMB prior to the first release :)

2001-08-17 12:25  joe_programmer

	* docs/duhspecs.txt: Proposal for new smaller format

2001-08-17 01:49  entheh

	* docs/duhspecs.txt: The DUH file format specification is now
	documented :)

2001-08-16 15:13  joe_programmer

	* tools/cit.c: Fixed a NULL dereferencing bug

2001-08-16 14:38  entheh

	flow control effects done

2001-08-16 03:33  entheh

	* src/resample.c, tools/cit.c, tools/citbugs.txt: Wahoo, resampling
	fixed! Also did something to cit.c and added citbugs.txt.

2001-08-15 22:15  joe_programmer

	* src/resample.c: Fixed compilation warning

2001-08-15 18:50  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/sample.c, src/sequence.c, tools/cit.c:
	Various stuff... cit.c improved, the sequence signal can now be
	started halfway through...

2001-08-14 23:32  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Yay, volume slides! :-)

2001-08-14 16:06  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Some of the effects work! Yay! :-)

2001-08-14 04:32  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: cit.c has been revamped somewhat. It's a hell of a
	lot uglier, and has lost some features. However, it is supposedly
	more faithful to the IT standard.  Thank goodness the IT converter
	is not to be the central attraction :-)

2001-08-13 12:36  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: cit.c now loads everything in the IT file. It has
	been adapted to support everything described in the ittech.txt file
	that comes with Impulse Tracker 2.14. However, the conversion is
	still as awful as ever :-)

2001-08-11 22:40  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: Some of the "Damn, I need more information"-style
	comments in cit.c have been replaced with information on what the
	stuff really is :D

2001-08-10 21:30  entheh

	* examples/playduh.c: allegro_exit()/allegro_message() bug
	partially fixed in playduh.c.  Still problems in case of usage(),
	and failure on allegro_init().

2001-08-10 20:07  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/getsig.c, src/sequence.c: Removed the
	MAX_SAMPLES limitation. STREAM_SIZE can be increased now.

2001-08-10 19:31  entheh

	* examples/playduh.c, include/dumb.h, src/play.c: A few
	enhancements to the playback interface.

2001-08-09 10:35  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/play.c, src/resample.c, src/sample.c,
	tools/cit.c: RESAMPLE_PICKUP stuff added, but there's a bug. Trying
	to fix it...  Various other minor changes

2001-08-06 18:06  entheh

	* include/dumb.h, src/resample.c, src/sample.c, tools/cit.c:
	Resampling code is in a separate file, and extensive comments have
	been written for it. cit.c has very limited volume support now.

2001-08-05 10:18  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: A check in cit.c has gone from ASSERT to if :-)

2001-08-03 23:23  joe_programmer

	* tools/cit.c: Fix to the it->duh converter

2001-08-03 23:12  entheh

	src/datduh.c, src/getsig.c, src/llload.c, src/load.c, src/main.c,
	src/play.c, src/register.c, src/sample.c, src/sequence.c,
	tools/cit.c: CIT (IT Compiler) working, just about. Tut tut, such a
	name, so suggestive of monopolistic intentions... But anyway, the
	new ASCII art and credits are at the top of every file!

2001-08-03 11:46  entheh

	* tools/cit.c: cit.c added. Currently unchanged from Bob's IT
	loader, except that the header files have been hard-included, and
	it now compiles as C rather than C++. Oh, and check out the new
	ASCII art :-)

2001-08-02 17:49  entheh

	* src/sample.c: Changes to the sample signal so that no special
	case is required at the end of a sample when resampling.

2001-08-02 14:33  joe_programmer

	* src/tools/it/: load_it.cpp, modulus.h, typedef.hpp: Added code to
