Bugs in cit.c
-------------

Please add to this list if you find cit.c is unfaithful to your IT file in any way (other than stuff that isn't implemented yet).

channel->sample is only initialised when the instrument is changed. This means multisample instruments don't work properly.

New SET_VOLUME commands are only written to the DUH file in the specific case that the channel volume changes. If any other volume changes, no command is written.

cit.c is likely not to exhibit the same behaviour as IT when dealing with conflicting volume and effect column commands.

Music length not properly converted. Winamp reports 4:05 on the .it and .xm, but 2:20 on the .duh
