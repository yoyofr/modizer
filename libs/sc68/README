ABOUT THE SC68 PROJECT

  sc68 is a portable Atari ST and Amiga music player. This project
  comes with many sub-projects. Some of which are required or
  recommended. Others are optional or only intended to
  developers. Some are just side projects. Many of the side projects
  are plugins for existing music players (winamp, audacious,
  foobar2000, vlc ...) or audio back-end (directshow, gstreamer).

  The original sc68 player was developed in 1997 on a Acorn Risc PC
  computer. The very first versions were able to play a standard
  Atari-ST soundchip player on a 33mhz ARM6 CPU and I still had
  resource to work with that computer.

  To this day sc68 is still share some of the design choices made
  at the time specifically with performance in mind.

  The Amiga simulator was never the heart of the project. It was more
  like a summer's day idea. I love have always been with the Atari-ST.

  A great deal of time has been spent to rip and convert music for the
  sc68 music database. At the moment (2016) I have mostly completely
  stop working on that database. I help (to an extend) with the sndh
  music database which I recommend where Atari-ST musics are
  concerned. I will probably someday convert all sndh files back to
  sc68 files for the sake of it.

  ST FOREVER !
