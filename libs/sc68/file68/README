ABOUT FILE68

  file68 is the library used to load and manage sc68 compatible
  files. That was the original idea. Over time it has become a general
  utility library serving a lot of facilities for all sc68 related
  projects.


DEPENDENCIES

  o unice68 (preferable)

    sc68 project's to depack Atari-ST ICE packed files. It's
    *REQUIRED* to load wildly distributed Atari-ST SNDH files that are
    the machine de facto standard.

  o zlib (recommended)

    A massively spiffy yet delicately unobtrusive compression.
    Library. Allowing to load gzipped version of the supported file
    format. Specially for .sc68 files that are not natively
    compressed.

  o libao (optional see below)

    Xiph.org cross platform audio library. It's optional but
    recommended for building sc68 command line program. Without it the
    player will only be able to produce a raw PCM stream. libao adds
    support for audio output as well as common audio file recording
    (.wav and such). If you only intend to build a plugin you probably
    do not need it.

  o libcurl (optional)

    a library for transferring data with URLs. Used to extend the read
    the reach of file68 via support remote file transfer protocol
    supported by cURL (HTTP,FTP,SMB ... the list is long).
