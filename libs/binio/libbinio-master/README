Description:
------------
The binary I/O stream class library presents a platform-independent
way to access binary data streams in C++.

The library is hardware independent in the form that it transparently
converts between the different forms of machine-internal binary data
representation.

It further employs no special I/O protocol and can be used on
arbitrary binary data sources.
