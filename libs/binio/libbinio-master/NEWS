This is a brief overview of user-visible changes in libbinio.

Changes for version 1.5:
------------------------
- Fix off-by-one error in memory streams.

Changes for version 1.4:
------------------------
- Support for pkg-config on UNIX systems.
- Moved default header installation directory to $pkgincludedir
  (aka $includedir/libbinio) to prevent filename clashes with other
  libraries.

Changes for version 1.3:
------------------------
- Fixed a small interface bug.
- Fixed data type mismatch on non-32-bit systems in peekInt().

Changes for version 1.2:
------------------------
- Ported to QNX.
- Red Hat & Mandrake .spec files.

Changes for version 1.1:
------------------------
- Removed unused config header file.
- writeString() methods now return number of characters written.
- Changed behaviour of readString(): The delimiter doesn't default to '\0'
  anymore. If no delimiter is given, always up to 'amount' characters are read.
- error() now returns a bit field of error flags instead of just one error
  value. Multiple errors can now occur at once.
- Added 'NotFound' error flag, indicating a file not found error.
- The 'Eof' error code is now set only when reading _past_ the end of a stream,
  not on the last byte.
- Added peekInt() and peekFloat() methods to peek an integer or a floating-point
  number in a stream, without extracting it.
- Added ateof() method to binistream class that returns true when the stream is
  at the last byte.
