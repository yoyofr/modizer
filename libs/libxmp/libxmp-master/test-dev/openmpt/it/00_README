Development: Test Cases/IT

   From OpenMPT Wiki
   Jump to: [5]navigation, [6]search

   This test suite is a collection of IT modules that were created while
   discovering playback bugs in OpenMPT. It is meant to be an easy way to
   check for regressions when code is changed, or to verify your own
   player’s routines if you are concerned about playback compatibility.
   The tests are designed in a way so that it is easy to figure out if
   your player is working correctly. In most test cases, your own player’s
   output can be heard on the left channel, while Impulse Tracker’s output
   is heard on the right channel. This way, it is easy to find out whether
   everything works as intended or if there are any discrepancies without
   having to read any long test descriptions. When it is impossible to do
   such a cross-verification, a more detailed description of the test can
   usually be found in the sample, instrument or comment text.

   Bit-exact output is not the goal of this test suite, correct playback
   is, so slight deviations from Impulse Tracker’s output (e.g. different
   resampling algorithms, pop reduction, etc.) are acceptable. Some tests
   will only sound correct on the first run. Unless stated otherwise, it
   is not important that the test output sounds identical when looping the
   module.

   Most test cases are documented (more or less) in OpenMPT’s source code
   with a reference to the filename of the test case. I am sorry that many
   tests do not have proper descriptions − I have started this
   documentation years after I have fixed some of these issues and can
   thus not remember all the details anymore. If you are stuck with one of
   the tests, you may have a look at specific source code revisions that
   are provided with most tests to see what was changed in the code to
   make it work correctly.

   Last but not least, please keep in mind that some descriptions might be
   wrong or too general. Sometimes, the description might be correct in
   the given test case, but changing the test case might invalidate the
   description. If you know better than me, please correct the texts, and
   please ask me if you need more information one of the test cases. The
   documentation is not always optimal because the test cases have been
   written long before I have created this site.

Autovibrato-Reset.it[[82]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision ???.
   Download: [83]Autovibrato-Reset.it
   Description: The autovibrato sweep is not reset when using portamento.

Bidi-Loops.it[[84]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 793.
   Download: [85]Bidi-Loops.it
   Description: In Impulse Tracker’s software mixer, ping-pong loops are
   shortened by one sample. This does not happen with the GUS hardware
   driver, but I assume that the software drivers were more popular due to
   the limitations of the GUS, so OpenMPT emulates this behaviour.

CarryNNA.it[[86]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1503.
   Download: [87]CarryNNA.it
   Description: This is a very interesting test case, because it actually
   sounds different when using Impulse Tracker’s WAV writer and Sound
   Blaster (and probably other drivers) output. The main difference is
   that the Sound Blaster driver will only consider the envelope carry
   flag if the New Note Action is not “Note Cut”. The WAV writer does not
   check for the NNA and will always apply the carry flag if it’s set.
   OpenMPT goes after the WAV writer, while XMPlay (at the time of
   writing) uses the Sound Blaster behaviour for the volume and panning
   envelope, but the WAV writer’s behaviour for the filter envelope
   (because of a bug report some years ago). Obviously it is hard to
   consider which of the two behaviours is correct, so I would just say
   that both are. :)

cut-carry.it[[88]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1165.
   Download: [89]cut-carry.it
   Description: Envelopes that have the carry flag set cannot be “picked
   up” / continued after the note has been cut.

emptyslot.it[[90]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1671.
   Download: [91]emptyslot.it
   Description: I think, Impulse Tracker treats instruments like an
   additional layer of abstraction and first replaces the note and
   instrument in the pattern by the sample and note assignments from the
   sample map table before further evaluating the pattern. That would
   explain why for example the empty sample map slots do nothing in this
   module.

env-flt-max.it[[92]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1090 (?).
   Download: [93]env-flt-max.it
   Description: If resonance is not applied, the filter envelope’s maximum
   value does not enable any filtering. However, it also does not disable
   any filtering when returning from a non-maximum point. This pretty much
   works like Zxx commands.

EnvLoopEscape.it[[94]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT currently fails this test.
   Download: [95]EnvLoopEscape.it
   Description: Here, OpenMPT exits the sustain loop too early.

EnvLoops.it[[96]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1213.
   Download: [97]EnvLoops.it
   Description: In this test, all possible combinations of the envelope
   sustain point and envelope loops are tested, and you can see their
   behaviour on note-off. If the sustain point is at the loop end and the
   sustain loop has been released, don't loop anymore. Probably the most
   important thing for this test is that in Impulse Tracker (and
   Fasttracker 2), envelope position is incremented before the point is
   evaluated, not afterwards, so when no ticks have been processed yet,
   the envelope position should be invalid.

EnvOffLength.it[[98]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 4009.
   Download: [99]EnvOffLength.it
   Description: If an envelope sustain loop happens to end on exactly the
   same tick as a note-off event occurs, the envelope is not yet released.
   It will be released whenever the loop end is being hit again.

EnvReset.it[[100]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1481.
   Download: [101]EnvReset.it
   Description: Impulse Tracker resets envelopes under some more or less
   weird conditions. This tests some of them.

extreme-filter-test-1.it[[102]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1090.
   Download: [103]extreme-filter-test-1.it
   Description: If resonant filters are rendered with integer arithmetic,
   they may produce scratching noises in some edge cases. You should not
   hear any scratches or other weird noises when playing this example.

extreme-filter-test-2.it[[104]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1090.
   Download: [105]extreme-filter-test-2.it
   Description: Same as the above test case. xmp breaks this module’s
   output even more than older versions of OpenMPT.

Fade-Porta.it[[106]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1144.
   Download: [107]Fade-Porta.it
   Description: After a note has been stopped in some way (for example
   through fade-out or note cut), tone portamento effects on the following
   note are ignored, i.e. there is no portamento from the stopped note to
   the new note.

filter-7F.it[[108]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1090 (?).
   Download: [109]filter-7F.it
   Description: A small test case that demonstrates that full cutoff
   should not enable the filter if no resonance is applied. Resonance is
   only ever applied if the cutoff is not full or the resonance is not
   zero.

FilterEnvReset.it[[110]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1132.
   Download: [111]FilterEnvReset.it
   Description: A cutoff value of 0 should not be reset to full cutoff
   when triggering a note just because the filter envelope is enabled.
   This bug is probably very specific to OpenMPT, because it gets rid of
   some unneccessary code.

filter-nna.it[[112]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1169.
   Download: [113]filter-nna.it
   Description: This test is just there to be sure that the
   filter-reset.it and filter-reset-carry.it test cases do not break NNA
   background channels.

filter-reset.it[[114]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1165.
   Download: [115]filter-reset.it
   Description: As mentioned already, filtering is only ever done in IT if
   either cutoff is not full or if resonance is set. When a Z7F command is
   found next to a note and no portamento is applied, it disables the
   filter, however in other cases this should not happen.

filter-reset-carry.it[[116]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1165.
   Download: [117]filter-reset-carry.it
   Description: I think this is also just an extenion to the previous test
   case, to make sure that it does not break anything else.

FineVolColSlide.it[[118]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 2400.
   Download: [119]FineVolColSlide.it
   Description: Unlike fine volume slides in the effect column, fine
   volume slides in the volume column are only ever executed on the first
   tick — not on multiples of the first tick if there is a pattern delay.
   Thus, the left and right channel of this example should always have the
   same volume.

flt-env-carry.it[[120]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 693 (?).
   Download: [121]flt-env-carry.it
   Description: Envelope carry on the filter envelope. I think this is
   just a general test on how envelope carry is applied. It is possible
   that Impulse Tracker’s MMX drivers will play this in a different way
   from the WAV writer.

fltmacro.it[[122]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision ???.
   Download: [123]fltmacro.it
   Description: This test uses a custom macro configuration that uses the
   instrument volume to control the filter cutoff. A correclty implemented
   MIDI Macro system should pass this test.

freqreset-noins.it[[124]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 325.
   Download: [125]freqreset-noins.it
   Description: When using multisample instruments, even notes with no
   instrument number next to them can change the sample (based on the
   active instrument’s sample map). When switching between samples, you
   must not forget to update the C-5 frequency of the playing sample as
   well.

globalvol-invalid.it[[126]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 290.
   Download: [127]globalvol-invalid.it
   Description: Out-of-range global volume commands (V81...VFF) should not
   change the current global volume. This test module should remain
   completely silent.

GlobalVolume-Macro.it[[128]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT currently fails this test.
   Download: [129]GlobalVolume-Macro.it
   Description: Global volume, channel volume and various other parameters
   are taken into account when interpreting the 'u' and 'v' letters in
   MIDI macros. However, this feature seems to be quirky, and I have
   decided not to support these quirks in OpenMPT, as I do not think that
   anyone used this feature in Impulse Tracker very much and I would want
   it to work in a sane way when using it to control instrument plugins in
   OpenMPT. The quirks are:
     * Channel and global volume seem to be applied one row after they
       have been set. This does not seem to be the whole truth, though, as
       looking at pattern 0, row 9, you should hear that IT applies the
       M40 channel volume change on row 10.
     * Instrument / sample volume also seems to be applied one row late
       when using the 'u' macro, but not the 'v' macro (compare first and
       second pattern, row 15 - 22 each).

   There are also some problems with volume swing which might be fixed
   later.

gxsmp.it[[130]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1671.
   Download: [131]gxsmp.it
   Description: Another test case with an empty sample map slot which is
   simply ignored by Impulse Tracker.

gxsmp2.it[[132]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1671.
   Download: [133]gxsmp2.it
   Description: Going one step further by also changing the sample next to
   that portamento.

gxxtest.it[[134]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT currently fails this test.
   Download: [135]gxxtest.it
   Description: And another similar test.

ins-flt-porta-reset.it[[136]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision ???.
   Download: [137]ins-flt-porta-reset.it
   Description: Instrument filter settings should not be applied if there
   is a portamento effect.

InstrumentNumberChange.it[[138]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1902.
   Download: [139]InstrumentNumberChange.it
   Description: While Impulse Tracker cuts playing samples if it
   encounters an invalid sample number in sample mode, the same does not
   happen if we are in instrument mode.

macro-lastnote.it[[140]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 947 (?).
   Download: [141]macro-lastnote.it
   Description: A test of the MIDI macro letter “n”. This letter will
   always send the MIDI note value of the last triggered note, note cuts
   and similar “notes” are not considered. This module should remain
   silent as both channels should receive exactly the same cutoff values.

MultiZxx.it[[142]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 947 (?).
   Download: [143]MultiZxx.it
   Description: A MIDI macro can contain more than one MIDI message. In
   this case, the Z90 macro sets both the filter cutoff frequency and
   resonance, so if only the first MIDI message is considered in this
   macro, both patterns will sound identical. If the macro is interpreted
   correctly, they will sound different.

NoMap.it[[144]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1671.
   Download: [145]NoMap.it
   Description: Yet another sample map test case. Why are there so many of
   them? They are all fixed by the same code...

NoSlide.it[[146]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision ???.
   Download: [147]NoSlide.it
   Description: Not sure what this test case is supposed to do.

NoteFade1.it[[148]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 317.
   Download: [149]NoteFade1.it
   Description: A “note fade” note (any invalid note) should not do
   anything in sample mode. The sample should not be stopped.

NoteFade2.it[[150]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 317.
   Download: [151]NoteFade2.it
   Description: A “note fade” note (any invalid note) should fade out the
   instrument using its fadeout value.

noteoff2.it[[152]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision ???.
   Download: [153]noteoff2.it
   Description: The sample changes on rows 4 and 20, but not on rows 8 and
   24.

noteoff3.it[[154]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT currently fails this test.
   Download: [155]noteoff3.it
   Description: This is the same as noteoff2.it, but with old effects
   enabled. In this case, the sample should never fade out.

Off-Porta.it[[156]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1344.
   Download: [157]Off-Porta.it
   Description: When "Compatible Gxx" is disabled, the key-off flag should
   only be removed when triggering new notes, but not when continuing a
   note using a portamento command (row 2, 4). However, you should keep in
   mind that the portamento flag is still set even if there is an offset
   command next to the portamento command (row 4), which would normally
   nullify the portamento effect (see [158]porta-offset.it).

Off-Porta-CompatGxx.it[[159]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 0 (temporarily
   broken in rev. 1344).
   Download: [160]Off-Porta-CompatGxx.it
   Description: When "Compatible Gxx" is enabled, the key-off flag should
   also be removed when continuing a note using a portamento command (row
   2, 4, 6). This test case was written to discover a code regression when
   fixing [161]Off-Porta.it).

PatternDelay-NoteDelay.it[[162]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1240.
   Download: [163]PatternDelay-NoteDelay.it
   Description: Delayed notes (using SDx) that are on the same row as a
   Row Delay effect are retriggered on every repetition. Notes without a
   note delay are not retriggered.

PatternDelays.it[[164]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1224.
   Download: [165]PatternDelays.it
   Description: Tick delays (S6x) are added up, but when there are
   multiple row delays (SEx), only the first one is considered. The tricky
   part here is that Impulse Tracker even ignores all row delays next to a
   SE0 row delay. I suggest to do the following:
     * Initialize a row delay variable with 0.
     * Go through all channels. If there is a row delay on the current row
       and row delay is 0, set row delay = parameter + 1.
     * Calculate the complete row length: row length = (speed + tick
       delay) * max(1, row delay)

PatternDelaysRetrig.it[[166]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1221.
   Download: [167]PatternDelaysRetrig.it
   Description: Rows on which a row delay (SEx) effect is placed have
   multiple “first ticks”, i.e. you should set your “first tick flag” on
   every tick that is a multiple of speed + tick delay. In this test
   module, the note pitch is changed multiple times per row, depending on
   the row and tick delay values.

PortaInsNum.it[[168]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1671.
   Download: [169]PortaInsNum.it
   Description: Portamento with funny sample maps. Without compatible Gxx,
   portamento between different samples should play the new sample.

PortaInsNumCompat.it[[170]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 2842.
   Download: [171]PortaInsNumCompat.it
   Description: Portamento with funny sample maps, in compatible Gxx mode.
   With compatible Gxx, portamento between different samples should keep
   playing the old sample.

porta-offset.it[[172]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 0.
   Download: [173]porta-offset.it
   Description: Unlike Fasttracker 2, Impulse Tracker ignores the
   portamento command if there is an portamento command next to an offset
   command. Even ModPlug Tracker 1.16 gets this test right.

PortaReset.it[[174]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 4181.
   Download: [175]PortaReset.it
   Description: Impulse Tracker completely resets the portamento target on
   every new non-portamento note, i.e. a follow-up Gxx effect should not
   slide back to the previously triggered note.

PortaSample.it[[176]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1671.
   Download: [177]PortaSample.it
   Description: Impulse Tracker executes the portamento when switching to
   instrument two on the second row when compatible Gxx is disabled.

PortaSampleCompat.it[[178]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 2842.
   Download: [179]PortaSampleCompat.it
   Description: Impulse Tracker executes the portamento and doesn't switch
   to the new sample on the second row when compatible Gxx is enabled.

RandomPan.it[[180]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 2545.
   Download: [181]RandomPan.it
   Description: Pan swing should not be overriden by effects such as
   instrument panning or panning envelopes. Previously, pan swing was
   overriden in OpenMPT if the instrument also had a panning envelope. In
   this file, pan swing should be applied to every note.

RandomWaveform.it[[182]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 3670.
   Download: [183]RandomWaveform.it
   Description: When selecting the random waveform for panbrello, the
   “speed” nibble indicates for how many ticks the random value will be
   held. This behaviour is not used for vibrato / tremolo.

retrig.it[[184]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 364.
   Download: [185]retrig.it
   Description: A combination of the retrigger effect and instrument
   envelopes. Not sure how this works.

retrig-short.it[[186]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1140.
   Download: [187]retrig-short.it
   Description: Impulse Tracker does not retrigger notes that are shorter
   than the duration of a tick. One might argue that this is a bug in
   Impulse Tracker, but OpenMPT emulates it anyway.

s7xinsnum.it[[188]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1062.
   Download: [189]s7xinsnum.it
   Description: Changing the NNA action through the S7x command only
   affects the current note - The NNA action is reset on every note
   change, and not on every instrument change.

s77.it[[190]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 561
   (preliminary), 1112.
   Download: [191]s77.it
   Description: The S77 / S79 / S7B commands pause the instrument
   envelopes, they do not turn them off. S78 / S7A / S7C should resume the
   envelope at exactly the position where it was paused. In this test, it
   is again very important that the envelope position is incremented
   before the point is evaluated, not afterwards (see EnvLoops.it).

SampleNumberChange.it[[192]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 0.
   Download: [193]SampleNumberChange.it
   Description: Contrary to InstrumentNumberChange.it, even ModPlug
   Tracker 1.16 passes it.

scx.it[[194]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1109.
   Download: [195]scx.it
   Description: The SCx command cuts notes just like a normal note cut
   (^^^), it does not simply mute them. However, there is a difference
   when placing a lone instrument number after a note that was cut with
   SCx and one cut with ^^^, as it can be seen in this test case.

SlideDelay.it[[196]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 3520.
   Download: [197]SlideDelay.it
   Description: If there's a note delay, slide and vibrato commands in the
   volume column next to it should not start before the delay has
   finished. So if there's a fine volume slide next to a SD5 effect should
   start on the 6th (one-based) tick. If this was a normal volume or pitch
   slide and the speed was 6 ticks per row, it would never execute, as the
   first non-zero tick would be the seventh tick.

SmpInsPanSurround.it[[198]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1259.
   Download: [199]SmpInsPanSurround.it
   Description: Sample and instrument panning override the channel
   surround status, i.e. surround is turned off by samples or instruments
   with panning enabled.

surround-pan.it[[200]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1134.
   Download: [201]surround-pan.it
   Description: Pan swing, panbrello, panning envelopes, etc. should have
   no effect on surround channels.

SusAfterLoop.it[[202]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1085.
   Download: [203]SusAfterLoop.it
   Description: When a sample sustain loop, which is placed partly or
   completely behind a “normal” sample loop is exited (through a note-off
   event), and the current sample playback position is past the normal
   loop’s end, it is adjusted to current position - loop end + loop start.

swaptest.it[[204]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision ???.
   Download: [205]swaptest.it
   Description: A test focussing on finding the correct sample playback
   position when switching samples “on the fly” (using instrument numbers
   without notes next to them). The module should remain silent when being
   played.

swing1.it[[206]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1046 (?).
   Download: [207]swing1.it
   Description: Probably a very MPT-specific bug, as OpenMPT was adding
   the volume swing to the current volume, so even after setting the
   volume to 0, it was possible that you could hear the sample playing.

swing2.it[[208]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1046 (?).
   Download: [209]swing2.it
   Description: This module should remain completely silent, as the random
   variation is multiplied with the sample volume.

swing3.it[[210]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1046 (?).
   Download: [211]swing3.it
   Description: Of course you are not supposed to produce the same
   sequence of random number to fulfil this test case. I think this was
   just a test to explore which volume variables are actually affected by
   volume swing, and how it is applied.

swing4.it[[212]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1046 (?).
   Download: [213]swing4.it
   Description: Same as above.

swing5.it[[214]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1046 (?).
   Download: [215]swing5.it
   Description: Same as above.

tickdelay.it[[216]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1306.
   Download: [217]tickdelay.it
   Description: This test detects whether out-of-range note delays are
   handled properly. If the SDx parameter is greater than the total row
   length (including tick delay), any note and volume effects next to it
   are supposed to ignored (interestingly, the instrument number is saved,
   but not instantly used).

tremolo.it[[218]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 345 (?).
   Download: [219]tremolo.it
   Description: A test for checking if tremolo tables are implemented
   correctly.

vibrato.it[[220]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1189.
   Download: [221]vibrato.it
   Description: A test for checking if vibrato tables are implemented
   correctly when old FX are disabled.

vibrato-oldfx.it[[222]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1189.
   Download: [223]vibrato-oldfx.it
   Description: A test for checking if vibrato tables are implemented
   correctly when old FX are enabled. Vibrato is played backwards in this
   mode!

VolColMemory.it[[224]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1545.
   Download: [225]VolColMemory.it
   Description: Volume column commands a, b, c and d (volume slide) share
   one effect memory, but it should not be shared with Dxy in the effect
   column. Furthermore, there is no unified effect memory across different
   kinds of volume column effects (that's how OpenMPT used to handle it up
   to revision 1544).

vol-env-carry.it[[226]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1781.
   Download: [227]vol-env-carry.it
   Description: Similar to flt-env-carry.it. This test case temporarily
   broke in revision 1481 and was fixed in revision 1781.

Volume-Macro-Letters.it[[228]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 1465.
   Download: [229]Volume-Macro-Letters.it
   Description: This test demonstrates how Zxx macros are parsed in
   Impulse Tracker:
     * Macros are evaluated only on the first tick.
     * They appear to be parsed after note / instrument information has
       been read from the pattern, but before any other effects (excluding
       "Set Volume").
     * 'u' and 'v' macros seem to emit at least a value of 1, not 0 - v00
       corresponds to Z01.

   I am not quite sure why the first row with notes on it emits a filter
   value of 1, and I am not even completely sure why OpenMPT gets this
   right. If interpreted correctly, the module should stay silent (minus
   slight filter artefacts, of course - but they should be nearly
   inaudible).

weirdloop.it[[230]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT passes this test since revision 0.
   Download: [231]weirdloop.it
   Description: A nice broken pattern loop. The voice should say “1 4 2 1
   4 2” and then repeat forever “3 4 2”. Theoretically, this would even
   work in ModPlug Tracker 1.16, if it did not reset the Cxx target on
   song loop.

wnoteoff.it[[232]edit]

   Current status: OpenMPT currently fails this test.
   Download: [233]wnoteoff.it
   Description: Note Off + instrument / portamento combinations.

   In total, OpenMPT passes 70 out of 75 tests.
