                       if the sample size is not doubleword aligned, you
                       should encounter the missing bytes as zero.

  The value 255 (unknown) should be used when:

    -  There is no possibility of knowing the recording source (e.g.
       a program converts raw sample to LDSS), or the programmer does
       not define that field; When value 255 is being used,
       one cannot assume anything about the sound board used.

  >>>> NOTE: The Dxx means that "xx" is a note number (where 00 is C-0,
             01 is C#0, 12 is C-1, and so on...) which is played in the
             drum channel (default is Chn #16 on General Midi) and not a
             regular MIDI program, which is redundant in such case.

Undefined chord

 |255|  UNDEFINED

NOTES:   - The 'Undefined' (255) value should be used in all the cases unless
           the user has actually defined the chord type. value 0 MAY NOT
           BE USED AS DEFAULT! for example, if a tracker would like to force
           the users to define all the chords, it will know that 255
           is not-yet defined. However, players or any MultiMedia product
           may interpret '255' as '0' for presentation purposes.
         - If bits 6 and 7 are on, respectively, it means that the current
           note (or chord) is played on more than the current octave,
           it can possibly be played on two octaves or three octaves
           simultaneously (or the first and the 3th octave only)
   VER2  - 'ver2' means that the 1st and the 2nd notes of the chord is in
           the octave above, rather than in the same octave.
           Example: chord C-2 (minor) = notes  G-2  C-3  E-3
   VER3  - 'ver3' means that the 1st note of the chord is in the octave
           above rather than in the same octave.
           Example: chord C-2 (minor)= notes  E-2  G-2  C-3
   VER4  - 'ver4' means that the 1st note of the chord played is also in
           the next octave. Example: chord C-2 = notes  C-2  E-2  G-2  C-3
         - The slash (/) char appears on some of the chords refers to the
           alternative name for the same chord.

****************************************************************************

    PROGRAMMERS/DEVELOPERS NOTE:


  - LDSS is not as huge as it seems. it takes only additional 112 bytes
    for independent sample, and consider the fact that each file always
    takes 4096 bytes (or 2048) on a magnetic storage media.
  - LDSS is also not as complicated as it seems. I aware to the fact that
    most of the programs will not use all the fields anyway, so each field
    has a non-used value (I don't expect all programs to calculate CRC,
    but it should be there)
  - Trackers programmers! remember not to throw-away the LDSS details,
    when loading 'LDSS' samples.
    if you are using your own format, remember to include all the LDSS
    information. it's only 50 (Aprox) additional bytes per sample (some
    of the LDSS values are used anyway!). suggested action is to save it
    directly before dumping each sample, and check for LDSS when loading.


   THE NEW FEATURES OF THE L.D.S.S FORMAT AND THEIR MEANING:

  - LDSS introducing the sample crediting. Now the sample will carry
    the name of it's creator, the program which has been used and the
    sound card used. This can really be good for statistics, and
    people will learn more about the sources of their samples.
    (of course, one who wants can remove the copyright, but why ?)
  - LDSS introduced the 'SAMPLE KIND'. Each sample can be cataloged
    by it's kind, whether it's drum, piano or sound efx, so a tracker
    can easily direct sample to it's directory, or a player could use
    the information for some MultiMedia presentations (imagine yourself
    a player shows how to play a module, and can recognized different
    chords and instruments, i.e. when a guitar playing it shows guitar)
  - Another IMPORTANT feature of LDSS is the extensibility header.
    a program may add any information it wants to the header,
    by setting a new value in offset 63h, and setting an ID stamp in
    offset 90h. and all this while remaining the sample usable to all
    LDSS compatible programs.

    COPYRIGHT:

  - The LDSS file format was developed by me (Nir Oren) in 1996.
    however, the author donates this file format to the public domain,
    and it may be used freely by any product, provided a proper credits
    will be give in the program's documentation.
    In no event should this document be modified by anyone except the
    author itself. This document may be included in any archive with any
    program. Additional notes about LDSS by different people may be
    included in SEPARATE files.
