A library to play Commodore 64 music.<br/>
<br/>

Libsidplayfp is a C64 music player library which integrates
the reSID SID chip emulation into a cycle-based emulator
environment, constantly aiming to improve emulation of the
C64 system and the SID chips.<br/>

STILView (or more precisely, the STIL class written in C++) is intended to be
compiled with the various SID emulators available on many platforms to provide
the capability of showing STIL and BUG information along with the given SID
that is currently being played in the emulator. It requires HVSC v2.6
(post-update #12) or later to function correctly, but it will work with
earlier versions to a limited extent.
