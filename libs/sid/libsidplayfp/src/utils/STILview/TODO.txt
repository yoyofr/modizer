- For multitune entries STILView should return all the occurences of a
  requested field, not just the first one.
- Add MD5 support. (STIL needs to add an MD5 field, too.)
- Switch to maps and strings found in the C++ Standard Library for containers
  and strings (almost done).
- For easy operation add a single all-encompassing get() member function like:
  char *get(string/MD5, bool globalComment, bool fileComment, bool stilEntry,
    bool bugEntry, int tune = 0 (specific), field = all (or specific))
- Make code more ISO C++ compliant, move as much as possible into STIL class
  (const inits, etc.).
