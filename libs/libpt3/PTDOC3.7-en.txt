                Pro Tracker v3.7x module format

   File extension - .m or .pt3.
   Numbers represent offset to various areas in the module,  and
their respective size (in decimal).

+0 (13) "ProTracker 3." - ID string. Vortex Tracker doesn't have
 it!
+13 (17) "7" (or "6","5","4", or even "3" ) - subversion number.
 You should notice, that PTv3.4vx modules and lower use other,
 "assymetrical" volume table, and in  PTv3.3x  uses  alternative
 note table "Pro Tracker", which isn't  the  same  as  currently
 used table with same name.
+14 (16) " compilation of " - optional, any text with same size.
+30 (32) module name, ASCII, unused symbols filled with spaces.
+62 (4) " by " - is not checked, though " By " can be indicator
 of linear volume table being used.
+66 (32) author name, ASCII, unused symbols filled with spaces.
 So first 98 bytes are used for authoring string.
+98 (1) For usual AY modules: code #20.
        For TS modules: number of patterns  N  (current  version
        should contain #30). Patterns for first AY  has  numbers
        going in  reverse  order  from  the  last:  N-1,N-2, ...
        Second AY has numbers going in direct order:  0,1,2, ...
        Position (order) list has patterns N-1,N-2,...
+99 (1) frequency  table  number:  0=Pro Tracker  (aka 1625000),
 1=Sound Tracker, 2=1750000 (other names,  though  unrelated  by
 content are ASM or PSC), 3=RealSound (aka 1625000+, bad attempt
 to move table 0 to 1.75MHz). The table occupies 192 bytes,  and
 contains divisors for frequencies for 96 notes,  starting  with
 the C-1. These values are directly used for AY registers. Lower
 bytes are prior to high  bytes  (little  endian,  intel/zilog).
 PT3 compiler stores table used  in  module,  into  player  code
 with offset of #200 (512). Volume table  is  stored  at  offset
 #100 (256). Current versions of PT are built without compiler.
+100 (1) tempo.
+101 (1) song end (1=single position) - not used in player.
+102 (1) song loop (0=loop to very beginning).
+103 (2) Psa_chn=offset to pattern table.
+105 (32*2) offsets from the beginning of the module to samples,
 starting with sample 0. Two bytes per sample. Sample #0 is  not
 used  within  current  editor  versions.  Every  unused  sample
 contains values (0,0)
+169 (16*2)  offsets  from  the  beginning  of  the  module   to
 ornaments, starting with ornament 0. Two  bytes  per  ornament.
 Orament #0 is "clear" ornament, so ornaments itself consists of
 3 bytes 0,1,0. You can use this ornament with other  data,  but
 it will not be clear, and no clear (ornamentless) sounds  going
 to be possible. Every unused ornament contains zeroes.
+201 (?*3+1) position list (orders). Contains number of patterns
 (0..84), 3 bytes per each. Code #ff means end of the table.
 Pro Tracker v3.3x-v3.5x doesn't support >42 patterns.
 Pro Tracker v3.6x doesn't support >46 patterns.
 Pro Tracker v3.69x, v3.7x doesn't support >48 patterns.
+Psa_chn (?*6) pattern table. Contains offsets to data for  each
 channel:
   ++0 (2) track A
   ++2 (2) track B
   ++4 (2) track C
 Noise channel (separate column in editor)  is  a  part  of  the
 channel B
+? (?*?) channel data, tracks themselves.

 Track data is encoded as a queue of operators:
================================================================
#00 - end of track.
 Pro Tracker doesn't work with modules, which use more  than  64
 lines. Such modules can be played with any players,  or  edited
 in Vortex Tracker, but Pro Tracker is unable to load them.
#01, delay, Lsl, Hsl - Gliss(Slide) effect. Delay - is the  time
 in 1/50 of seconds, after which note divisor will be shifted by
 Lsl+256*Hsl. This  offset  is  accumulated  by  player  in  the
 variable, and THEN used to get final note. Thus  ornaments  are
 applied prior to any precise frequency effects.
 v3.7x: if delay=0, offset  is  accumulated  during  whole  note
 being played (tone shift to fit envelope frequency, etc).
#02, delay, Lmax, Hmax, Lsl, Hsl - Tone Portamento effect. 
 Delay - is the time  in  1/50  of  seconds,  after  which  note
 divisor will be shifted by Lsl+256*Hsl. Lmax+256*Hmax - is  the
 maximum value (absolute) after reaching of which it  will  stop
 effect.  Not  used  starting  with  PT3.6x,  because   it   can
 accumulate wrong way.
#03, offset - sample offset. Sample starts with specified line.
#04, offset - ornament offset. Ornaments starts  from  specified
 line.
#05, YEStime, NOtime - vibrate/gate.
#08, delay, Lsl, Hsl - envelope  slide  effect.  Envelope  value
 gets Lsl+256*Hsl each delay frames.
#09, tempo - tempo change  (1/50  per  tracker  line).  Ordinary
 player (playFAS*.H) is unable to play with less than temp=2.
 If modules uses tempo=1, use slower players.

NB: effect parameters (#0x) are placed  not  after  effect  code
itself, but after end of line(!). If multiple effects  are  used
(which shouldn't happen anyway), first are latest  effect,  then
before latest, and so on...

#10, smp*2 - turn off  Envelope,  restart  ornament  and  change
 sample to premultiplied value (direct table offset).
#1x, Henv, Lenv, smp*2 - change sample number,  retrig  ornament
 and turn on Envelope with type x-1  and  period  Lenv+256*Henv.
 Envelope phase is retriggered, even if it's the same.
#20-#3F - Noise offset (only used in channel B).
#4x - Change ornament to x (Envelope doesn't stop).
#50-#AF - Play note, and stop processing till next line.
#B0 - Turn off Envelope.
#B1, lines - Change pause (distance to  next  line  to  "line").
 Work not only for current line, but  for  following  too  (till
 another pause change happen).
#Bx, Henv, Lenv - same as #1x, but without sample  change.  I.e.
 just turn on Envelope of type x-1 with respective period.
#C0 - no note (R), and STOP processing till next line.
#Cv - change volume to v (1-15)
#D0 - STOP processing.
#D1-#EF - change sample (1-31)
#Fx, smp*2 - change ornament to x and sample to next parameter
(which is premultiplied to achieve better speed). Envelope is
turned off.

================================================================

+? (?*(?*4+2)) - samples.
   ++0 (1) - loop

Comments and additions are welcomed!

Addition from 10.xi.02:
1. (Sergey Bulba): Note tables "ASM" or "PSC" have nothing in
common with respective editors. Modules from these editors
should be imported with Sound Tracker table.
2. Module can also use sample=0, if it's used commands with
commands #10 and #Fx. So it can use 32 samples overall.
3. Information about Portamento, Loop and #B1 is confirmed.
4. Updated information about samples.
Adition from 24.ii.03:
5. Updated information about Envelope disabling.
Addition from 25.iii.03:
6. Added information that PTv3.6x supports up to 46 patterns.
7. If ornament goes lower negative values, it clamps note to
lowest possible note - C-1. Getting over 95 has unpredictable
behaviour.
Addition from 26.vii.03:
8. Updated info about PT3.6x.
9. Maximum module size, loaded in PT editor 0 #3300 bytes, or
#4000 bytes for "cjf" version.
Addition from 20.iii.04:
10. PT3+67 can have 48 patterns, but it's not guaranteed that
same amout will be supported in following versions.
Addition from 29.vi.04:
11. Updated about operators #10 and #B1.
12. In PT3.69 you can set ornament number without affecting
Envelope, and players are playing it so. Though VTII doesn't
support it YET.
Addition from 26.viii.04:
13. If noise is enabled at particular line of sample, Envelope
period doesn't get its accumulation.
Addition from 27.x.04:
14. Operator #1x (Sergey Bulba)
Addition from 6.xi.04:
15. (Sergey Bulba)
Almost all tables are crafted with errors (not even close to
ideal values for 1750000 and 1773400). More or less properly
is the table 1 = Sound Tracker. It fits perfectly for import
of module from almost any ZX editors. Comparing with "ideal"
scale for 1773400 it's shifted by 2 half-tones down.
In addition - note 24 (B-2) is ugly and should sound line A-2.
Sadly, it's the only table which works for 1773400 classic ZX.

Table #2 almost ideal for 1750000, and all notes sound as they
displayed in editor.

Unfortunately, note tables for different versions of ProTracker
vary widely, especially table #2, which at some point could be
called ASM/PSC, and perfectly fit for 1773400. Note table #1
is unique in this sense - it's the same among all Pro Tracker 3
versions.

Table #0. Official name - "ProTracker". Not used anywhere except
for PT3. It didn't get updates till PT3.4r. Starting from other
versions of PT3.4x till now it stays modified. Doesn't fit good
to any AY frequency.

Table #1. Official name "SoundTracker". This table migrated from
Pro Tracker 2. Modified version of note table from Sound Tracker
editor. The only table which is the same in all versions of PT3.
Fits for STC, STP, FTC, GTR, PT2, PT1, FLS, and for SQT with a
stretch (from second note), also ASM and PSC. The table is
fairly good for 1773400 Hz, but has offset by 2 half-tones down.
So C-2 sounds as standart A#1. Note B-2, which should sound like
A-2, actually has 1/9 frequency offset from what it should be.

Table #2. Official name "ASMorPSC". When it first appeared in
PT3.4r, it was version of ASM(PSC) table, without first two
notes, and layed along perfect values for 1773400 Hz. Following
PT3.4x versions have it modified very heavily, so that ASM and
PSC modules sound not better than with table #1. First version
work well for SQT. Modern table #2 fits perfectly for 1750000.
Following table is nor the better.

Table #3. Official name "RealSound". As previous, appeared in
PT3.4r and received lots of updates till then. Derived from
table #0, and shifted by 1 halftone down. Thus, it also doesn't
fit any of standart AY frequency.

16. 48 patterns. 64 lines. In TurboSound modules second module
uses patterns number (47-patter_number), and in position (order)
list exactly these big numbers are set.

17 (19 aug 06). Addition about PT v3.7: +98; slide with delay=0.

18 (08 may 07). Addition about PT v3.7x and Vortex Tracker.
