Just a quick update this time: I had big plans for new features this cycle, but ended up getting swamped in end-of-year deadlines, and was only able to deliver a small portion of what I had intended (and late, at that). Still, I did manage a quick port-and-polish of the unit testing module and all of its dependencies, so I'm well positioned to begin the new user scripting API work in earnest. I will be on the road a fair bit over the next quarter, but I'm still optimistic that I can get enough of the new system online to give folks a sense of where things are headed.

If you haven't been following along, you can see what I've been up to, and why, over at [my premake-next repository on GitHub](https://github.com/starkos/premake-next). I'm also posting regular updates here, as well as at [@premakeapp](https://twitter.com/premakeapp).
