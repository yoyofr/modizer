flac 1.3.2.
The FLAC package has been left pretty much untouched, except for a few changes:
 *  Obviously, unnecessary folders and files (documentation, makefiles, etc.) have
    been removed.
 *  src/share/win_utf8_io/win_utf8_io.c has been modified to compile with UNICODE.
    Only additions were made and those are marked with // OpenMPT
 *  For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
    See ../build/premake/ for details.
