/*
* Poor man's emulation of a 6581 revision SID based filter.
*
* In the real 6581 SID HW the respective filter circuits rely on a particular implementation of
* "fake op-amps" that is very dependent on specific component behavior under borderline
* conditions (e.g. transistors running in subthreshold, triode, and saturation modes while
* serving as a resistor). This seems to be the root cause why actual 6581 chips are very sensitive
* to the slightest variations of used raw materials and why different SID production batches
* rarely sound the same.
*
* A correct simulation gets rather messy/complex and the resid team seems to have done a great job
* accurately modeling the actual physical design (see residfp-2.2). While fascinating from a technical
* perspective, it seems questionable if a respective correct low-level modeling is worth the trouble
* for practical purposes, e.g. my 4 6581 SIDs (various R3 and R4 models) all sound completely
* different and while a correct model could be parameterized to correctly emulate all the dozens
* (if not hundreds) existing chip variations, an emulation perfectly tuned to mimic the wrong SID chip
* specimen may be less desirable than a flawed approximation which more closely matches the user's
* expectations.
*
* Antti Lankila's analysis (https://bel.fi/alankila/c64-sw/fc-curves/curves.png ) confirms the
* variability between different SID chip instances. It shows the types of cutoff curves that can be
* expected and shows that there is a specific distortion effect (kinking) - which the resid team traced
* back to the D/A conversion. It seems to be strongest at the 1/2 mark and then get successively
* weaker at higher subdivisions 1/pow(2,x). After the 1/32 steps the distortions seem to get so small
* that they are barely distinguishable from the regular noise in the measurements..
* note: The above graph uses a logarithmic y-scale, i.e. one linear scale the curves would just be
* steeper.
*
* The previous implementation had also been based on Hermit's respective jsSid code. Inspired by Antti
* Lankila "type 3" design (see "procedure" explained here: https://bel.fi/alankila/c64-sw/index-cpp.html )
* I decided to upgrade the implementation with respective distortion features. -> "high voltage favors 
* distortion"
*
* As a base a simple S-curve is used (e.g.
* http://www.fooplot.com/#W3sidHlwZSI6MCwiZXEiOiIwLjk3LygxLjArZXhwKC0oKHgqMi0xNTAwKS8xNDUpKSkrMC4wMjkiLCJjb2xvciI6IiMwMDAwMDAifSx7InR5cGUiOjAsImVxIjoiMC45Ny8oMS4wK2V4cCgtKCh4KjIpLzE0NSkpKSswLjAyOSIsImNvbG9yIjoiI0YwMTExMSJ9LHsidHlwZSI6MTAwMCwid2luZG93IjpbIi0xMDAwIiwiMTAyNCIsIi0wIiwiMSJdfV0- )
* and for different distortion levels that same curve is provided in differently offset variants.
* See https://www.wothke.ch/websid_filter/ for online UI.
*
* This implementation is not based on a physical modeling of actual SID HW components (resistors, caps, etc).
* Looking at current resid research, respective "correct" modeling quickly seems to get fairly complex
* and I just do not have the respective electronics background to even try a proper modeling
* approach. But as was explained above there are "infinite" variations of how actual SID chips sound and
* even if one had the perfect model, the generated audio output will most likely be different from what
* the users expects. The approach taken here is therefore to take some shortcuts and hope that it sounds
* close to what most users expect.
*
* Known limitations:
*
* - The distortions in real 6581 chips are so bad, that the resulting audio output is often 
*   plagued by massive "random clicks/beeps" and/or "noise" (see my recordings of real SID output) - which 
*   makes for a poor listening experience for the majority of songs that were not specifically designed 
*   to depend on a specific flaw or one specific chip specimen. This emulation will sound much "too clean"
*   and not be able to reproduce those distortions.
