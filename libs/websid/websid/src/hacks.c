/*
findings regarding sprites-bad-cycles handling:

- sprite size: 24x21 pixels
- PAL: visible area within the border is 200 lines high. screen has 312
lines. vblank takes around 30 scanlines, i.e. total of around 282 visible
scanlines.. supposing that sprites start at 0 then the maximum reachable by
an Y-expanded sprite would be 255+42=> 297, i.e. the complete visible screen
can be covered with sprites but there are some lines during vblank where
sprites will have no effect


summary of background infos from "VIC by Christian Bauer":

per shown sprite and raster the VIC may perform 4 bus accesses: "psss" ("p" is
the "sprite data pointer"  and "s" is "sprite data") these accesses occur
in 4 consecutive "half-cycles" the 1st and 3rd of which are handled during the
phase always allocated to the VIC and only the 2nd and 4th are performed in the
phase normally allocated to the CPU.. i.e. they cause bad-cyles for the CPU)

"..p-accesses are done in every raster line and not only when the belonging
sprite is just displayed" => doesn't matter to the CPU since they are performed
in the half-cycle phase dedicated to the VIC anyway

"..s-accesses are done in every raster line in which the sprite is visible
(for the sprites 0-2, it is always in the line before.." each sprite has a
hard-coded cycle-position when this access is performed (e.g. for sprite 3
it is cycles 0/1).

"In the first phases of cycle 55 and 56 (PAL only!), the VIC checks for every
sprite if the corresponding MxE bit [i.e. "sprite enable"] in register $d015 is
set and the Y coordinate of the sprite (odd registers $d001-$d00f) match the
lower 8 bits of RASTER".. this spec seems to be INCORRECT! what about the
handling of the (extended) height of the sprite? respective "sprite data"
needs to be read for every line where it is supposed to be displayed!

if "sprite-data" needs to be read the bus is blocked for CPU-reads 3 cycles
earlier (if there are at least 4 cycle "gaps" due to 2 or more sprites that
are NOT enabled, then this may repeat!, example: enabled 0,3,6 => then a
3-cycle CPU-read stun would be used before EACH of these "sprite data"
accesses)

=> assumption: sprite enabling is checked/setup once at cycle 55/56
(unfortunately the respective explanations in Bauer's text are ambiguous)

"In the first phase of cycle 58... display of the sprite is turned on"
=> how does this relate to what "happend" in cycles 55/56? supposing sprite 0
enable it turned ON in cycle 57.. the required 3-cycle CPU-read stun would
NOT have been triggered so there is NO WAY the VIC could steal the necessary
"sprite data" read cycles in cyles 58/59!

conclusions:

- assuming that respective sprite enabling can be "statically" updated once
per scanline (e.g. at cycle 56), the following would still need to be
implemented (in worst case the timing of VIC register changes might need to
be tracked - including sprite y-coords and y-expansion status?):

  * different handling for sprites 0-2 and 3-7 (properly map the setting to
    the 2 scanlines that it affects)
  * calculate sprites that are visible on a specific scanlines (which
    makes for quite a few extra comparisons)
  * rules for keeping bus blocked (e.g. if a disabled sprite is between
    two enabled ones, etc) and for prepending 3-cycle "CPU-read stun"
	must be checked in each cycle (might be done with a precalculated
    256x63 lookup table, so the extra runtime costs might be tolerable)

- the specifications in the available docs leave certain details rather sketchy
and there is a considerable risk that a respective impl would still be incorrect,
i.e. songs that really depend on cycle exact delay-timing would still fail (e.g.
a "off by one" may accumulate and cause "badline avoidance" scemes to
catastrophically fail.. completely destroying the song's timing - see
Utopia_tune_6.sid).

- very few songs actually depend on sprite-bad-cycles (and those that do use
a limited set of sprite-configurations) => until there is a signicicant
amount of songs that would actually benefit it isn't worth the trouble to
add a generic implementation
