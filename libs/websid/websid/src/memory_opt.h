/*
* Performance optimization only.
*
* This violates the normal encapsulation of the "memory" impl for the 
* purpose of slightly faster access in timing critical logic.
*
* It should not normally be used and the same functionality is available
* via the regular memFooBar APIs (corresponding to MEM_FOO_BAR).
* 
* Rationale: For very small functions (e.g. getters) the overhead involved
* in a function call seems to be significant as compared to the run time
* of the actual functionality. In this context here, the problem may be somewhat
* WebAssemby specific: C normally provides the "inline" directive however
* for some reason code seems to break completely when it is used for WebAssembly
* compilation (i.e. "inline" cannot be used here). Also function call overhead
* may be higher than usual: It might be a contributing factor that some 
* WebAssembly engines seem to perform stack consistency checks before every
* function call (Chrome seems to be worse affected than Firefox). I similarly 
* replaced respective small functions that are critical during single-cycle-
* clocking in other parts of the implementation (see cia and cpu). Whithout 
* and functional changes this refactoring alone lead to a decrease of run time 
* by 10% (in my preliminary tests). 
*
* CAUTION: With the big swings of response-times caused by whatever else
* might be happening on the CPU and/or in the browser, the relatively small
* benefits of inlining are hard to quantify reliably. It may always be that some
* supposed speedup was just an "accidental" pause in browser GC activity.
* I will use the below macros for now - such that a simple search/replace 
* can be used in case I might drop the idea at a later stage.  Use 
* OPT_USE_INLINE_ACCESS define to toggle inlining.
