                          SID FILE FORMAT+ DESCRIPTION

INTRODUCTION
============

This document describes the "SID file format+" used for multi-SID tunes
played by WebSid. The format is a simple generalization of the respective
SID FILE FORMAT used by the HVSC and this document uses the same structure
as the respective HVSC document. This is not an official HVSC format
but a "proprietary" modification. It addresses shortcomings of the official
SID FILE FORMAT with regard to multi-SID songs:

1) it allows to use an arbitrary number of SIDs (rather than hard coded special cases) 
2) it allows to model how SIDs should be wired to available mono/stereo output channels

Ideally the respective extensions should eventually be integrated as an official HVSC 
version. 

Since SID v4E is a simple modification of the respective v3/4 formats, only 
the differences are described below.

An old/official version song file can be easily extended with the v4E specific 
meta-data (e.g. using a hex editor) since except for the multi-SID specific additions at the
very end of the header the file/header structure is unchanged.

SID files use the .sid file extension.


LEGEND
======

+xx - The hexadecimal offset of the field from the beginning of the SID file

BYTE - 8-bit binary value

WORD - 16-bit big endian encoded binary value


Hexadecimal values appear with the `0x` prefix in the document. Other values are decimal.


The SID file header v4E
=======================

[.. unchanged ..]

+04    WORD version

Valid value:
- 0x004E 	The version number used (representing ASCII letter 'N') was chosen to be at a safe 
			distance from the official versions used by HVSC. (This should avoid any clashes with
			new official versions that HVSC might introduce in the foreseeable future.)


+06    WORD dataOffset

The dataOffset is still the offset from the start of the file to the binary C64 program 
contained in the file.

The main difference to older versions is that a variable length header is used, whose
length depends on the number of SIDs that are actually used. This means that 
the respective dataOffset MUST NEVER be guessed based on the file version but instead the  
dataOffset field must always be consulted!

Example: for a 1-SID file the offset would be 0x7C, for a 2-SID file the offset would be 0x7E, etc.


[.. unchanged ..]

+76    WORD flags

This is a 16 bit big endian number containing the "same" bit-fields as in the original
HVSC format. 

The only difference to the "official" HVSC versions is that the bits 6-7 and 8-9 ARE NOT
used for 2nd and 3rd SID specific information.

New flag:
- Bit  6     output channel for main $d400 SID - aka SID #0 (default: 0 )
		     the bit allows for a maximum of 2 channels (which seems sufficient since 
		     all the songs found so far seem to max out at 2 stereo channels, and support for 
		     exotic scenarios like 5.1 etc seems to be overkill)

- Bits 7-15  unused


+78    BYTE startPage unchanged
+79    BYTE pageLength unchanged


+7A (etc) WORD nSidFlags

For each additional SID there is one additional nSidFlags WORD. A 0-WORD must be used
as an "end" marker, i.e. with only 1 SID the nSidFlags at +7A would be 0. (This corresponds to the 
reserved 0 WORD that old versions require at 0x7A.)

Flags used for additional SID:
- Bits 0-3  unused
- Bits 4-5  SID version (same as respective flag for main SID - see +76):
	        00 = Unknown: defaults to respective main SID setting
	
- Bit  6    output channel (same position as respective flag for main SID - see +76) 
- Bit  7    unused 
- Bits 8-15 address of SID chip (same "2 center nibbles" format as used in original HVSC formats,
            e.g. "D420" would be represented as 0x42)
