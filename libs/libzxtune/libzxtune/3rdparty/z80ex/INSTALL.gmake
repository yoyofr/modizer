Building with GNU toolset:
--------------------------------------------------------

for build using GNU C (GCC,mingw,cygwin,DJGPP),
issue 'gmake'. static and shared libraries will appear in "./lib".
alternatively you may do "gmake static" for building static libries only
(use that with DJGPP 'coz it doesn't support shared libs),
or "gmake shared" for building shared library only.

you may override some build parameters by editing the Makefile, or by
giving command line arguments to gmake, e.g. "gmake parameter=value"
these are:
* ENDIANNESS -- CPU endianness, one of WORDS_LITTLE_ENDIAN, WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
* OPSTEP_FAST_AND_ROUGH -- fast and rough opcode step emulation mode (0 - off, 1 - on)
	when this mode is on, timings of internal I/O operations are ignored,
	and tstate callback feature is disabled


Installing (UNIX/MacOS X):
--------------------------

issue "gmake install" as superuser.
(default install prefix is /usr/local, which may be changed in Makefile.)
then do "/sbin/ldconfig" as superuser to update DSO links and cache
