v0.0.6 (2012-05-17):

     * When the -w option is used during extraction, the path specified
       is now first created if it does not already exist.
     * The command line tool now exits with a failure return code if an
       error occurs during extraction.
     * A "catch-all" header file (lhasa.h) has been added.
     * The public header files installed with the library can now be
       included and used externally.
     * A pkgconfig file is now installed as part of the library
       (thanks Jan Engelhardt).
     * Make targets have been added for building Doxygen documentation
       and including them as part of the distribution.

v0.0.5 (2012-05-08):

     * Architecture-specific functions for running on Windows have now been
       fully implemented, and the command line tool passes all tests in the
       test suite on Windows (thanks roytam1 for bug reports).
     * Bug fixed where the command line tool would enter an infinite loop
       when extracting a truncated archive (thanks Jon Dowland).
     * Support added for archives with level 0 headers and Unix path
       separators (thanks roytam1).
     * The test suite now runs correctly outside of the Europe/London time
       zone (thanks Thomas Klausner).
     * A .spec file is now included for building rpm packages.

v0.0.4 (2012-05-01):

     * Special handling is now included for MacBinary headers generated
       by MacLHA.
     * The -w command line option was broken; it has been fixed.
     * A bug has been fixed where the timestamp and other metadata was
       not set properly for extracted directories.
     * Failures to set the UID/GID of extracted files are now ignored,
       rather than being treated as a fatal error.
     * Self-extracting archive files with long headers (up to 64KiB)
       are now supported. This fixes the handling with some Windows
       archives.
     * A Unix manpage has been added.
     * It is now possible to extract an archive from stdin, by using '-'
       as the filename.
     * The shorthand command line syntax "lha foo.lzh" to list an archive
       is now supported.
     * A bug with the wildcard pattern matching code has been fixed.
     * Proper regression tests have now been added for command line
       archive extraction.
     * A set of archives generated by LHmelt (Windows) have been added to
       the test suite.
     * The regression tests for testing file header parsing and CRC checks
       have been rewritten.

v0.0.3 (2012-04-22):

    Third beta release.

     * A fix has been added for a bug where missing parent directories
       were not being created properly.
     * Regression testing archives have been added from MacLHA v2.24.
     * In order to support MacLHA archives, code has been added that
       heuristically detects the MacBinary headers added by MacLHA
       and strips them off.

v0.0.2 (2012-04-17):

    Second beta release.

     * This version adds support for level 2 and 3 file headers. Lhasa
       should now be capable of decompressing most, if not all archives
       found in the wild.
     * A fuzz testing framework has been added for testing the
       decompression code. A couple of bugs have been fixed as a result
       of this.

v0.0.1 (2012-04-06):

    Initial version. This should be considered beta code, although this
    first version should already be capable of extracting the majority of
    archive files found in the wild. The main missing features are:

     * Lack of support for level 2 and 3 file headers.
     * Inability to create archives (only extract them).

    These are features that I aim to add in future releases. Other future
    features can be found in the TODO file.
