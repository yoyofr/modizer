XGM SOURCE ARCHIVE

This source archive is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. You can reuse these source code freely. However,
we possibly change the structure and interface of the program code without 
any advance notice.

HOW TO COMPILE

Open the workspace file top.sln with Visual C++ 7.0 or later
version. We can compile both KbMediaPlayer and Winamp version of
NSFplug on this workspace.

To make a KbMediaPlayer version of NSFplug, that is, in_nsf.kpi,
Please choose 'kbnsf' project as an active project.  Then, you can
build in_nsf.kpi by build menu.

On the other hand, to make a Winamp version of NSFplug, activate 
'wa2nsf' project and build it. 

Note that after the build process, VC++ copies the plugin files to:

C:\Program Files\KbMediaPlayer\Plugins\OK\in_nsf\in_nsf.kpi
C:\Program Files\Windamp\Plugins\in_nsf.dll

If you don't need to have these copies, please remove or modify the
 custom build settings.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I thank Norix and Izumi for the fruitful discussions and the NSFplug
users for their comments and bug reports.
