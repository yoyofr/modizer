NSFPlay/NSFPlug
===============

This is an NSF player program for Windows, and also a Winamp plugin. The original version of this program was written by Brezza and is still available at pokipoki.org.

To use as a Winamp plugin, simply copy the contents of the plugins folder to your Winamp plugins folder.

Full source code is available at:
- http://rainwarrior.ca/projects/nsfplay/

If you have any questions, comments, or find any bugs, please send them to me.

NSFPlay Keyboard controls
=========================

  Z > Prev
  X > Play
  C > Pause
  V > Stop
  B > Next


Command line arguments
======================

  NSFPlay [filename]
    Open and begin playing NSF file.
    > [filename] NSF or NSFE input file

  NFSPlay [nsf_filename] [wav_filename] (track) (milliseconds) >error.log
    Create WAV file from command line
    > [nsf_filename] NSF or NSFE input file
    > [wav_filename] WAV output file
    > (track) - optional, 1 if omitted
    > (milliseconds) - optional, sets PLAY_TIME

  Because it is a GUI application, errors cannot be reported to the command line
  console, but you can redirect errors to a log file with >.
  (>error.log in the example)

  Optionally any value from the configuration files can be temporarily set with
  an argument beginning with -. If this is done, the configuration will not be
  automatically saved on close, but can still be saved if you manually save
  the new configuration from the info page menu.

  NSFPlay -AUTO_DETECT=0
    > Disables automatic track length detection.

  NSFPlay -REGION=4
    > Force PAL region.

  The default INI configuration files can both be overridden from the command line.
  These will take effect before any other command-line parameters are applied,
  and only one INI/NSFPLAY substitute can be used. They can use an absolute path,
  or one relative to the current directory. If the file does not exist, NSFPlay
  will attempt to create it.

  NSFPlay -INI=override.ini
    > Override default in_yansf.ini file.

  NSFPlay -NSFPLAYINI=override.ini
    > Override default nsfplay.ini file.

Configuration files
===================

The default configuration file is in_yansf.ini, found in the plugins folder.
This will be automatically created when the program is run. If it can't be created
at its default location (e.g. access denied to C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins)
it will instead try to use your %APPDATA% directory under an NSFPlay folder.
(You can type %APPDATA%\NSFPlay into the Explorer address bar to find it.)

It will always check the folder next to in_yansf.dll first, so if this file is
present but not writeable, you may not be able to save settings unless it is
deleted to allow the %APPDATA% fallback.

The INI file location can be overridden with -INI.

The NSFPlay application has its own nsfplay,ini file, found next to the .exe,
or in %APPDATA%\NSFPlay if it could not be created there. (Use -NSFPLAYINI to
specify a different location.)

This has a few options to control the loading of the plugin. The last used
volume is saved at exit. NSFPlay could be used with other Winamp plugins, but
only with more basic features.

nsfplay.ini settings:
  PLUGIN: Path to player plugin. Default: plugins\in_yansf.dll
  VOLUME: 0-255 starting volume. Default: 255 (Does not affect WAV export.)
  SAVEVOLUME: 0 = don't save, 1 = save. Default: 1


Playlists
=========

NSFPlug supports Winamp M3U playlists in the same style as NEZplug.
The playlist is a text file with one track per line in the form:

filename::NSF,[song],[title],[time],[loop],[fade],[loopcount]

filename  - relative path to NSF file
song      - track number from the NSF (track 1 is the first track)
title     - title of the track
time      - h:m:s length of the track
loop      - h:m:s loop length, h:m:s- loop start time, - no loop, 0 no loop
fade      - h:m:s fade time
loopcount - number of times to loop, 0 default

NSFPlay 2.2 - 8/31/2012
Audio Emulation:
- Unmute on reset now sets $4015 to $0F instead of $1F.
- PAL noise frequency $1 now 8 instead of incorrectly 7.
- New VRC7 patch set, option to select alternative patch sets via VRC7_PATCH.

- VRC6 polarity inverted, phase reset now functions properly.
- FDS now uses NSF header $76/$77 to set up $6000-7FFF memory range.
- FDS $4087 bit 7 now mutes modulator.
- Enable periodic noise option fixed. (Forced perodic noise by accident.)
Other:
- Fixed improper $4015 read implementation (should return length counter status), also DPCM IRQ was not initialized.
- Default focus in keyboard window now the track list (to prevent accidental mouse scroll time expansion).
- Fixed Winamp visualizer timing inaccuracy, changed default keyboard delay/freq.
- Inverted VRC7 volume display in keyboard view.
- NSFe support.
- Added NSFe extension block 'text', contains null terminated string of any length (NSF text).
- Removed broken ENABLE_DCF config option. HPF=256 now correctly disables HPF.
- Rewrote LPF and HPF, should have a more usable range of options now.
- Removed XXX_FR/XXX_FC options, now XXX_FILTER works like LPF for each device.
- Memory R/W access is now exclusive to the first device that accepts it; prevents FDS multi-expansion write conflicts.
- Title string will automatically remove whitespace at its beginning or end.
- Fixed single instance bug, was failing to open new NSF file when chosen from explorer.
- Fixed conflicts between keyboard commands and other dialogs.
- Removed tag menu from info page. Does not appear to apply to NSFs.
- Fixed incorrect PAL pitch when QUALITY=0.

NSFPlay 2.1 - 3/27/2012
Audio Output:
- Fixed race condition in audio buffering; stand alone NSFPlay would occasionally get stuck stuttering.
- Produces stereo output, channel mixer dialog for panning and per-channel volume control.
- Fixed PCM playback speed; CPU execution was counting requested clocks, not clocks executed.
- Fixed accuracy of seek times.
- Loop detection now accounts for all audio registers, not just a subset of 2A03 and N163.
- N163 wavelength is actually 6-bit, not 3. Now allows sample length up to 256.
- Fixed FDS volume/sweep envelope caps. (Direct register writes can make them louder.)
- Fixed FDS modulation bias calculation and wrapping.
- Set default volume for VRC7 and FDS a little lower (to match expected levels).
- MMC5 PCM support (for both read and write mode).
- Added phase reset option to MMC5.
- MMC5 was missing length counter and audio register reads; rewrote to conform with APU.
- Adjusted phases for APU/MMC5 square channels to match NesDev's description.
- APU/DMC/MMC5 rewrite of envelope/length/sweep behaviour to use a frame sequencer instead of independent timers.
Options:
- Option to randomize noise on reset (on by default).
- Options cleanup, removed unused/deprecated options from .ini file.
- Using global LPF by default instead of on each device (saves CPU, same result).
- Keyboard view channel colour is now customizable in .ini file (CHANNEL_XX_COL).
Keyboard view:
- Fixed crash due to keyboard OnTimer being allowed before Reset() is executed by the PlayThread.
- Double buffering keyboard view to remove flicker.
- Different colours for different expansions in keyboard view.
- Fixed sound lag after seek.
- FME-7 now named 5B, N106 now named N163.
- DPCM now named DMC in keyboard view.

- VRC6 saw volume now displays accumulator register.
- Corrected VRC6 saw pitch in keyboard view.
- Fixed trailing lines on N163 waveform display.
- DMC volume display no longer flipped (is now $4011 register value).
- DMC now shows sample frequency rather than byte frequency.
- Triangle and noise were not showing muting due to length counter of 0.
- Noise now has frequency display (either rate of random samples, or tonal frequency for periodic noise).
- Removed feature that extends the life of key dots beyond the frame the channel is active (frequency can change when key is silent, esp. VRC6 squares, which visibly jump to the wrong pitch)
Other:
- Save WAV button on NSFPlay.
- Command line WAV output for batch processing.
- Added extra NSF header information to "misc" text box, initial banks, load/init/play addresses, etc.
- Fixed thread-safety issue for configuration (was accessed liberally from many threads).

- Fixed improperly set WAVEFORMATEX header in libemuwa2 (allows execution on windows Vista/7).
- Corrected pitch of noise channel.
- Updated VRC7 default patch set.
- Added PAL support and pal flags indicator (PREFER_PAL=1 to prefer PAL for dual mode).
