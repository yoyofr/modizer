Tomoaki Hayasaka kindly pointed me to the "Red Book" that was one of the sources of information when 
he created his eupplayer (this book is what the "red pagenumber" references in this code comments 
refer to - there is also a "grey" book but he doesn't remember which book that was):

"Revised 3rd Edition FM TOWNS Technical Data Book" by Noriaki Chiba
(see https://archive.org/details/3FmTowns )


Below the Google translated Euphony data format description based on the respective section in that 
book (see p.609 ff). (unfortunately the automatic translation leaves a lot to be desired and the 
original "specification" seems to leave out more than it actually explains..)


There seem to be great similarities to MIDI, e.g. the MIDI "pitch bend" command has the code "E0" 
it also uses 14-bit passed as a LSB / MSB pair.. and MIDI data bytes are 7-bit (which explains
the respective eupplayer impl)


notes: 
- "n" in the "status" identifies the MIDI-channel.
- timing:  LSB + 0x80*MSB	= trigger time for a step
- the "track" IDs used in the commands are mapped to the actually used output channel
- velocity: how hard a note is struck (impacts loudness)
- aftertouch/presssure: how hard a key is still pressed down while note is playing..

In the traditional performance format for FM TOWNS, the time base has 96 chronometers per quarter tone.
This is a lock. The data has a fixed length with 6 bytes per packet.

Events include channel events and system exclusion events and others
, each of which has the function and format shown in the below tables.



EUP general packet format
------------------------

EUP uses a fixed 6 bytes per record format. Each record has the same basic structure: 

byte0		byte1		byte2		byte3		byte4		byte5
status		track		time		time		data 1		data 2
						(low)		(high)
							
							
							
EUP format (channel event)
---------------------------


event			status
				byte0	byte1	byte2	byte3	byte4	byte5			description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
note off		$8n		|	duration				|	OFF				The note length (duration) takes out
						LSB L	LSB H	MSB L	MSB H	VELO			 the lower 4 bits and makes 16 bits.
						
note on			$9n		track	time	time	pitch	ON				A note-on is always cured by its 
						number	LSB		MSB				VELO			companion note-off: come later
						
Polyphonic		$An		track	time	time	pitch	pressure		Specify the note number and pressure value.
key pressure			number	LSB		MSB		(note)	value

Control			$Bn		track	time	time	ctrl	set value		Specify control number and control value do.
change					number	LSB		MSB		value

program			$Cn		track	time	time	prog	dummy			Specify the program number.
change					number	LSB		MSB		value

channel			$Dn		track	time	time	presser	dummy			Specifies the pressure value.
Fresher					number	LSB		MSB		value


pitch bend		$En		track	time	time	bend	bend			Bend value (total of 14 bit) - book doesn't say what the bits mean - or if it is 2x 7bits - like eupplayer seems to think
						number	LSB		MSB		LSB		MSB				
						
						
All channel messages have MIDI channels. Replaced by the MIDI channel, but for that track! When 
the MIDI channel is 'omni', its Stay! MIDI Output in channel.



EUP format (system class exclusive event)
-----------------------------------------

event			status
				byte1	byte2	byte3	byte4	byte5	byte6			description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exclusive		$F0		track	time	time	dummy	dummy			First packet of exclusive data
status					number	LSB		MSB		($ff)	($ff)


data			data column												Arbitrary data arranged in multiples of 6 bytes
				Indefinite number of bytes (in units of 6 bytes)		(Fill the remaining part with criminal de)
				
end of			$F7		dummy	dummy	dummy	dummy	dumm			Packets after handling exclusive data
Exclusive				($ff)	($ff)	($ff)	($ff)	($ff)			Bok


Key of exclusive data No data is entered in the first packet, but data is entered from the second packet.
No other packet should be entered in the exclusive question, and the packet containing $F7(End of Exclusive) 
must be included afterward. must end with a packet. In that case, the extra part in the packet $FF put.



EUP format (other events)
-------------------------
