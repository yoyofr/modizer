Some songs produce quite a cacophony and it would be quite surprising if this is 
what the original composer actually intended (in some cases that might be 
the case since the expertise of some authors may actually have been lacking..).

However the minieup emulation does seem to have its flaws - which in some cases
may be responsible for abysmally bad audio output.

And finally there may be another explanation: Yet again this is one of those
cases where the stupid dumbfucks thought it a brilliant idea to throw all the 
add-on music library files into a shared folder (presumably to save disk space).
This however completely misses the point that respective files may actually exist in
multiple versions - and the filename is by no means a sufficiently unique 
identifier (see duplibs.zip for examples of respective files).
