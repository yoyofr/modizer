If some of the MDDs you try to play, sound "overdriven"/"distorted", it
is probl. because  they seem to use 9bit samples (instead of the ususal 8bit),
which are supposed to be played with a 14bit mixing genie for the default
amiga hardware.

Sorry, but those MMDs are currently not supported by the current replayer
code.
