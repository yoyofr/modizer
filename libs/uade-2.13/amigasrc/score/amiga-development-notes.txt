To assemble the sound core, use asmone (other assemblers might work too).

Follow these steps:

1. set asmone equ 0 (in the beginning of the source)
2. assemble
3. wb (write binary) start: start end: end

Remember to use only pc-relative addressing in your code. Following will not
work:
	lea label,a0		* this does not work
 use
	lea label(pc),a0  	* this works

The sound core can be run under amiga os, but not necessarily always.
For example, future composer 1.3 player can be run under amiga os. To do this
you must set "asmone equ 1" before trying.

The file delisymbols contains delisymbols for the resource program (to dis-
assemble deliplayers). You can modify delisymbols.s for that purpose (to
generate a new delisymbols file, assemble and wo (write object)).
