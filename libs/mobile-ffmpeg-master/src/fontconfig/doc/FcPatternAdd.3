.SH NAME
FcPatternAdd \- Add a value to a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>
.sp
FcBool FcPatternAdd (FcPattern *\fIp\fB, const char *\fIobject\fB, FcValue \fIvalue\fB, FcBool \fIappend\fB);
.fi\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Adds a single value to the list of values associated with the property named
`object\fI\&. If `append\fR is FcTrue, the value is added at the end of any
existing list, otherwise it is inserted at the beginning. `value' is saved
(with FcValueSave) when inserted into the pattern so that the library
retains no reference to any application-supplied data structure.
