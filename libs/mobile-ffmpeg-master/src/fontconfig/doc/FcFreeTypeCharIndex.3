.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Maps a Unicode char to a glyph index. This function uses information from
several possible underlying encoding tables to work around broken fonts.
As a result, this function isn't designed to be used in performance
sensitive areas; results from this function are intended to be cached by
higher level functions.
