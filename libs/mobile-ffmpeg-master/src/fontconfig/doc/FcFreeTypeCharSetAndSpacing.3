.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Scans a FreeType face and returns the set of encoded Unicode chars.
FcBlanks is deprecated, \fIblanks\fR is ignored and
accepted only for compatibility with older code.
\fIspacing\fR receives the computed spacing type of the
font, one of FC_MONO for a font where all glyphs have the same width,
FC_DUAL, where the font has glyphs in precisely two widths, one twice as
wide as the other, or FC_PROPORTIONAL where the font has glyphs of many
widths.
