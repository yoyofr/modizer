 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * Leptonica is a pedagogically-oriented open source site containing
 * software that is broadly useful for image processing and image analysis applications.
 *
 * \section features Featured operations are
 * 
 * + Rasterop (a.k.a. bitblt)
 * + Affine transformations (scaling, translation, rotation, shear) on images of arbitrary pixel depth
 * + Binary and grayscale morphology, rank order, and convolution
 * + Seedfill and connected components
 * + Image transformations combining changes in scale and pixel depth
 * + Pixelwise masking, blending, enhancement, arithmetic ops, etc.
 * + Ancillary operations include
 *
 * + I/O for standard image formats
 * + Utilities to handle arrays of image-related data types
 * + Utilities for generic stacks, queues, heaps and lists;
 * + and for byte queues and arrays of numbers and strings
 *
 * \section examples Example applications include
 *
 * + Octcube-based color quantization, with and without dithering
 * + Modified median-cut color quantization, with and without dithering
 * + Skew determination of text images
 * + Segmentation of page images with mixed text and images
 * + jbig2 unsupervised classifier
 * + Border representations of 1 bit/pixel images and raster conversion for SVG
 * + PostScript generation (levels 1, 2, 3) of images for device-independent output
 * + PDF generation (levels 1, 2) of images for device-independent output
 * + Dewarping images of text taken with a camera
 * + Book-adaptive text recognition
 * + Rendering text on an image
 * + Connectivity-preserving thinning and thickening of 1 bit/pixel images
 * + Line removal from a grayscale sketch
 * + Search for least-cost paths on binary and grayscale images
