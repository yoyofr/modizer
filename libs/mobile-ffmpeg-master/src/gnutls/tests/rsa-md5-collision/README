rsa-md5-collision README -- Information about rsa-md5-collision self tests.
Copyright (C) 2006-2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
See the end for copying conditions.

This directory contains colliding X.509 certificates for different
identities, from:

http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/TargetCollidingCertificates/

The certificates are used by a simple self-test script,
rsa-md5-collision, that check to make sure that GnuTLS reject both
certificate chains.

Below is the e-mail exchanges with the authors where they agree to
release the certificates under a permissive license, that allow the
files to be included here.

Great work, thanks!

I'd like to include your certificates in GnuTLS, a TLS implementation
that supports X.509, as self-tests of the certificate verification
logic.  Is this OK with you?

Btw, Gnutls rejected the certificates, we already disable MD5 for
verification purposes. :)

For our legal department, I'd like a clarification of the license on
the data, would you agree to release the certificates under the
following license?

Hi,
Thanks!
I can't speak for my coauthors, but it's all fine with me, though I find =
the year in your proposed copyright statement a bit odd (I would have =
expected 2006). There are no more authros involved.

best regards, Arjen Lenstra

Thanks.  Duh, I meant 2006, of course.  I'd appreciate if Marc and
Benne also replied.

Hi Simon,

When your software rejects any MD5 certificate I don't see why

Grtz,
