    psk: Allow non-NULL PSK usernames
    
    This commit closes #586.
    
    Two new functions are introduced: gnutls_psk_server_get_username2()
    and gnutls_psk_set_client_username2(), which are identical in behavior
    to those named similarly (without the final '2'), but allow arbitrary
    gnutls datums (not strings) to be used as usernames.
    
    Two new callback functions are also introduced, with their respective
    setters: gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function2() and
    gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function2().
    
    In addition, the password file format is extended so that non-string
    usernames can be specified. A leading '#' character tells GnuTLS that the
    username should be interpreted as a raw byte string (encoded in HEX).
    
    Example:
    
        #deadbeef:9e32cf7786321a828ef7668f09fb35db

    crypto-selftests-pk.c: Use deterministic signatures in test_known_sig()
    
    Use deterministic signatures for ECDSA and DSA in test_known_sig().  Do
    not call test_known_sig() for non-deterministic algorithms.  Do not run
    PK_TEST() for algorithms tested with PK_KNOWN_TEST().
    
    The deterministic algorithms are used if in FIPS-140 POST or if FIPS-140
    mode is disabled.  When called explicitly with FIPS-140 mode enabled,
    the pairwise-consistency test (PK_TEST()) is used instead.
    
    test_known_sig() was modified to support only deterministic algorithms.
    The "deterministic" parameter was replaced with the "flags" parameter
    through which the flags to be used in gnutls_privkey_sign_data() are
    passed.
    
    The hard-coded values for the ECDSA and DSA signatures were replaced
    with the values corresponding to the deterministic signatures to be used
    in known answer tests.  The unused values for GOST signatures were
    removed.

    Previously, test_sig() would use the same key regardless the value

    choose the key according to the value provided in bits.
    
    For RSA, only 2048 bits key is available for testing.  The calls were
    adjusted accordingly.
    
    Introduced 2048 bits DSA key in test_sig().  Removed unused 512 bits
    key, leaving only the 2048 bits key available.
    
    For GOST, use the same keys for test_sig() and test_known_sig().  Remove
    the unused keys.

    crypto-selftests-pk.c: Fix PK_KNOWN_TEST and PK_TEST
    
    Previously, when multiple tests where declared in sequence using one of
    the macros, only the first test would be executed.  This happened
    because a check for the GNUTLS_SELF_TEST_FLAG_ALL was embedded in the
    macro.  To allow more than one test to be executed in sequence, the
    check for the flag was removed from both macros.
    
    To keep the previous behaviour (execute only the first test) the check
    for the flag was moved to be after the first test, except for RSA since
    the RSA encryption test must be executed in FIPS mode.

    lib: use static assertion to check enum values
    
    We previously had checks of enum values with '#if', such as below:
    
     #define GNUTLS_EXTENSION_MAX_VALUE 31
    
     typedef enum extensions_t {
             ...
             GNUTLS_EXTENSION_MAX /* not real extension - used for iterators */
     } extensions_t;
    
     /* we must provide at least 16 extensions for users to register */
     #if GNUTLS_EXTENSION_MAX_VALUE - GNUTLS_EXTENSION_MAX < 16
     # error not enough extension types
     #endif
    
    This doesn't work as expected; because GNUTLS_EXTENSION_MAX is not
    defined as a preprocessor macro, it always expands to 0.  To properly
    do this check, we need to use static assert as provided as the
    'verify' macro in gnulib.

    keylogfile: simplify the callback mechanism
    
    This partially reverts commit 97117556 with a simpler interface.  The
    original intention of having the callback mechanism was to reuse it
    for monitoring QUIC encryption changes.  However, it turned out to be
    insufficient because such changes must be emitted after a new epoch is
    ready.

    testcompat-openssl: improve testing against secured OpenSSL versions.
    
    In Debian, and soon Ubuntu, OpenSSL is compiled with SECLEVEL=2 and
    requiring minimum TLSv1.2. However, smaller hashes/keys/versions are
    allowed if one enables SECLEVEL=1. Do so when testing pre v1.2 algos,
    and thus enabling testing more compatability combinations.

    This adds new tests, reduces running time, and removes test-tls13-obsolete-curves.py.
    The latter introduced too pendantic tests on curves we don't implement,

    it requires the server to error on mismatching entries (and we simply ignore
    them). As its value is low (we do not target to be a reference implementation
    for testing broken clients), it was removed.

    ocsp: set GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID if OCSP response indicates revocation
    
    This makes the OCSP based certificate verification adhere to the
    convention used throughout the library: "The 'GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID'
    flag is always set on a verification error and more detailed flags
    will also be set when appropriate."

    tls-sig: reverse bytes in TLS signatures for GOST signatures
    
    GOST TLS suites have one peculiarity: CertificateVerify message uses
    byte order opposite to the rest of GOST signature usage (BE instead of
    LE). So, reverse byte order in signatures in TLS code. For now this
    applies only to TLS 1.2 code. GOST TLS 1.3 ciphersuites will also follow

    GnuTLS is depending already on uint64_t being a properly defined type.
    So there is no need to have a special byte-array type for 8-byte
    integers. Use uint64_t instead, thus simplifying a code quite heavily.

    Currently last test case in psk-file expects that the server will

    client is able to receive server's fatal alert thus returning unexpected

    gnutls_session_get_data2: fix operation without a timeout callback
    
    When TLS1.3 was introduced, gnutls_session_get_data2 was modified
    to assume that the callbacks set included the timeout one which was
    not previously necessary except for some special cases. This corrects
    that issue and makes sure that gnutls_session_get_data2() does not
    fail (but not necessarily succeed), if that timeout callback is not
    set.

    gnutls-cli-debug: fix early break for no version supported check
    
    Currently gnutls-cli-debug code hardodes index of tests, after which it
    will check if any known protocols (SSL 3.0/TLS1.[0123]) are supported by
    the server. However this number is hardcoded and thus easy to break.
    This is exactly what happened after adding %ALLOW_SMALL_RECORDS check.
    Two tests were added in front of tests lists without updating this
    index.
    
    So let's make this check robust by adding another test which will return
    fatal error if no known protocols are supported. While we are at it,
    also simplify tests loop by removing internal loop completely and
    controlling opening/closing a socket with a flag.

    pkcs11: ignore login error when traversing tokens
    
    If a token is a general access device, it is expected that login
    attempt to that token returns error:
    https://github.com/p11-glue/p11-kit/blob/master/trust/module.c#L852
    
    On the other hand, _pkcs11_traverse_tokens treats the error as fatal
    and stops iteration.  This behavior prevents object search without
    token specifier if such tokens are registered in the system.

    ext/session_ticket: avoid calling memcpy on overlapping memory areas
    
    In _gnutls_encrypt_session_ticket, ticket.encrypted_state is allocated

    config: added ability to override and mark algorithms as disabled
    
    This allows the system administrator or the distributor to use
    the gnutls configuration file to mark hashes, signature algorithms,
    TLS versions, curves, groups, ciphers KX, and MAC algorithms as
    insecure (the last four only in the context of a TLS session).
    It also allows to set a minimum profile which the applications
    cannot fall below.
    
    The options intentionally do not allow marking algorithms as
    secure so that the configuration file cannot be used as an attack
    vector. This change also makes sure that unsupported and disabled protocols
    during compile time (e.g., SSL3.0), do not get listed by gnutls-cli.
    
    The configuration file feature can be disabled at compile time
    with an empty --with-system-priority-file.
    
    This patch it introduces the function gnutls_get_system_config_file()
    allowing applications to check whether a configuration file
    was used.

    ext/record_size_limit: distinguish sending and receiving limits
    
    The previous behavior was that both sending and receiving limits are
    negotiated to be the same value.  It was problematic when:
    
    - client sends a record_size_limit with a large value in CH
    - server sends a record_size_limit with a smaller value in EE
    - client updates the limit for both sending and receiving, upon
      receiving EE
    - server sends a Certificate message larger than the limit
    
    With this patch, each peer maintains the sending / receiving limits
    separately so not to confuse with the contradicting settings.

    certtool: generate RSA-PSS certificates from RSA keys
    
    When generating certificates it was not possible to generate
    an RSA-PSS certificate from an RSA key (common scenario). This
    fixes the certificate generation to include such a method.
    
    Ironically there was a test for this scenario but the test
    was limited to checking that the combination of certtool parameters
    succeeded; modified the test to check the textual expression of
    the certificate for the RSA-PSS indicators.

    tests: fix race condition in tls13/post-handshake-with-cert-pkcs11
    
    The test had a strange setup of server/client processes: the server
    runs in a child process and the client runs in a parent process.  The
    intention behind this was to detect softhsm availability in the parent
    process and exit with 77 if missing.  However, there was a potential
    race when the server exits and proceeds to the next call of start().
    
    This fixes the process setup and moves the softhsm detection at the
    program startup.

    gnutls_memset(): calling explicit_bzero() is enough to zero-fill a buffer
    
    If we use explicit_bzero() to zero-fill a buffer in gnutls_memset() we
    don't need to zero it again via a volatile trick later in this function.

    cert auth: reject auth if no signature algorithm is usable in TLS 1.3
    
    Previously, when there is no overlap between usable signature
    algorithms and the "signature_algorithms" extension in Certificate
    Request, the client failed in sending Certificate Verify, followed by
    a connection close.  In TLS 1.3, it is possible to keep the connection
    but reject the authentication by not sending Certificate Verify.

    handshake: increase the default number of tickets we send to 2
    
    This makes it easier for clients which perform multiple connections
    to the server to use the tickets sent by a default server. That's
    because 2 tickets allow for 2 new connections (if one is using each
    ticket once as recommended), which in turn lead to 4 new and so on.

    Previously we would wait an arbitrary value of 50ms for the

    wait for the estimated single trip time + 60 ms for the server
    to calculate the session tickets. This improves the chance
    to obtain tickets from internet servers during the call of
    gnutls_session_get_data2().

    messages may cause unexpected result if the output is standard output.
    
    With this option, user could redirect these messages to a specific
    file. This will be helpful in testing and tracking.
    
    Second, replace printf() function with log_msg() function
    
    This log_msg() function is used when "--logfile" is enabled.
    
    Third, add a functionality test for "--logfile" option

    Make false start and early start multi-thread recv/send safe
    
    An application that is sending and receiving from different threads
    after handshake is complete cannot take advantage of false start because
    gnutls_record_send2() detects operations during the handshake process
    as invalid.
    
    Because in early start and false start the remaining handshake process needs
    only to receive data, and the sending side is already set-up, this error
    detection is bogus. With this patch we remove it.

    ext/record_size_limit: account for content type octet in TLS 1.3
    
    In TLS 1.3, the protocol maximum of plaintext size is 2^14+1, while
    it is 2^14 in TLS 1.2.  To accommodate that, this introduces the
    following invariant:
    - when the maximum is set by the user with
      gnutls_record_set_max_size(), store it as is.  The value range is
      [511, 16834].
    - when the maximum is negotiated through record_size_limit extension,
      it can be [512, 16385].  In TLS 1.3, subtract by 1 to fit in [511,
      16384].

    x509: corrected issue in the algorithm parameters comparison
    
    Each certificate has two fields to set the signature algorithm
    and parameters used for the digital signature. One of the fields is
    authenticated and the other is not. It is required from RFC5280 to
    enforce the equality of these fields, but currently due to an issue
    we wouldn't enforce the equality of the parameters fields. This
    fix corrects the issue.
    
    We also move an RSA-PSS certificate in chainverify that was relying
    on invalid parameters, to this set of invalid certificates.

    If gnulib's network stack is brought (due to a dependency) in the library

    gnutls-serv: improvements in UDP server
    
    This modifies the server to deinitialize the session after use
    (avoiding leaks), and to only send the hello verify request when
    a client hello is seen.
    
    This also adds a basic unit test of gnutls-serv with the --udp option.

    tests: added tests for multiple ticket reception
    
    This introduces tests for the reception (parsing) of multiple tickets
    by a gnutls client. It uses the tlslite-ng server because unlike a gnutls
    server, tlslite-ng does send multiple tickets in a single record. That
    way we test that we can parse both ways of sending tickets.

    configure.ac: check if libatomic is needed
    
    gnutls source code uses the C++11 <atomic> functionality since
    https://github.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/7978a733460f92b31033affd0e487c86d66c643d,
    which internally is implemented using the __atomic_*() gcc built-ins
    
    On certain architectures, the __atomic_*() built-ins are implemented in
    the libatomic library that comes with the rest of the gcc runtime. Due
    to this, code using <atomic> might need to link against libatomic,
    otherwise one hits build issues such as:
    
    ../lib/.libs/libgnutls.so: undefined reference to `__atomic_fetch_sub_4'
    
    on an architecture like SPARC.
    
    To solve this, a configure.ac check is added to know if we need to
    link against libatomic or not. The library is also added to gnutls.pc.
    
    Fixes:

    The flag %NO_EXTENSIONS is disabling extension support while being functional
    
    That is, the %NO_EXTENSIONS option is the only documented way to disable
    extensions completely from a session. Clarify that message, mention that
    its behavior is undefined when combine with TLS1.3, and make sure that it
    is functional. The latter makes sure that safe renegotiation and extended
    master secret extensions remain disabled when this flag is given.
    
    That simplifies testing certain scenarios under TLS1.0 or TLS1.1 when
    no extensions must be used.

    When sending no extensions do not include a zero length
    
    According to RFC5246:
       The presence of extensions can be detected by determining whether
       there are bytes following the compression_method field at the end of
       the ServerHello.
    
    and as such we correct our behavior to not send the zero length bytes.
    This was our behavior in 3.5.x and 3.3.x branch, and thus this corrects
    a regression of gnutls with these branches.

    Previously we were only treating SIGSEGV as error though there is
    no reason to treat other signals as success and they may hide an
    actual error case (e.g., when SIGPIPE is received). With this change we
    treat any signals received by the child except SIGTERM as error, and
    we ensure that SIGPIPE is ignored in all tests.

    pass CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_CURRENT_USER.
    We also use the wide chars variants, in the event the ansi ones are
    silently rejected by windows store applications (which is not
    documented, but which I strongly suspect)
    This is equivalent to Wine's implementation of CertOpenSystemStore:

    pkcs11: fix memleak when querying for GNUTLS_PKCS11_TOKEN_MODNAME
    
    find_token_modname_cb uses p11_kit_config_option to retrieve the module
    name, but its return value must be free'd.
    
    Other fixes:
    - Do not silently truncate the output buffer, return an error instead.
    - If the module name is unavailable, do not write "(null)" to the
      output. Write an empty string instead.
    - The module path can be of arbitrary length, so passing output=NULL to
      learn the length seems reasonable, except that snprintf crashed on a
      NULL pointer dereference.

    Prevent applications from combining legacy versions of TLS with TLS1.3
    
    It can happen that an application due to a misconfiguration, enables TLS1.3
    in combination with TLS1.0 or TLS1.1 only. In that case a server which is
    unaware of the TLS1.3 protocol will reply by selecting the TLS1.2 protocol
    instead and that answer will be rejected by the client. With this change
    we ensure that TLS1.3 is not enabled in these problematic scenarios.

    ext/pre_shared_key: make ticket age calculation consistent
    
    Previously we used a pattern like this:
    
      uint32_t obfuscated_ticket_age, ticket_age_add;
      time_t ticket_age;
    
      ticket_age = obfuscated_ticket_age - ticket_age_add;
      if (ticket_age < 0) {
            ...
      }
    
    This always evaluates to false, because subtraction between unsigned
    integers yields an unsigned integer.  Let's do the comparison before
    subtraction and also use correct types for representing time: uint32_t
    for protocol time and time_t for system time.

    tls1.3: server returns early on handshake when no cert is provided by client
    
    Under TLS1.3 the server knows the negotiated keys early, if no client
    certificate is sent. In that case, the server is not only able to
    transmit the session ticket immediately after its finished message,
    but is also able to transmit data, similarly to false start.

    gnutls-serv: don't close connection properly when handshake is not yet complete
    
    In the case handshake is not yet complete and we need

    unclear termination at this stage. This addresses error detection
    issues with tlsfuzzer.

    When a Hello Retry Request is received, do not set our (transient)

    set to be TLS1.2. Introduced test suite using openssl and resumption

    hello_ext_parse: apply the test for pre-shared key ext being last on client hello
    
    We were incorrectly insisting on pre-shared key extension being last in
    both client and server hello. That was incorrect, as only in client hello
    it is required by TLS1.3 to be last.
    
    Quoting:
       The "pre_shared_key" extension MUST be the last extension in the
       ClientHello (this facilitates implementation as described below).
       Servers MUST check that it is the last extension and otherwise fail
       the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

       ClientHello (this facilitates implementation as described below).

    The pre-shared-key MUST always be last under TLS1.3 while the
    dumbfw extension should be last in order to do proper evaluation
    of extension size (gnutls requirement). As such the protocol
    requirement takes precedence.

    cipher: made TLS1.3 safe padding check optional
    
    This patch introduces the gnutls_init() flag GNUTLS_SAFE_PADDING_CHECK
    which makes the TLS1.3 safe padding check optional. That way applications
    which do not utilize the TLS1.3 padding do not get penalized by the performance
    drop in TLS1.3 packet processing. This addresses a regression in TLS1.3
    packet processing performance.

    Fix usage of 'autoreconf'
    
    'autoreconf' created a different configure script than ./bootstrap.
    The result was a broken wchar.h that failed to compile.
    
    The work-around was 'autoreconf -I gl/m4' which is not what a developer
    expects. This patch moves gl/m4/* to m4/ which is the default include dir
    for autoreconf.

    configure: Check for clock_gettime and fmemopen using a proper test
    
    Don't use AC_CHECK_FUNCS for these functions, but actually test by
    including the real header that defines the functions. This allows
    the macOS version selection work as intended, making the references
    to these functions weak if targeting a version of macOS where these
    functions aren't available. Thanks to -no_weak_imports, these weak
    references end up in failed linker tests, marking the functions as
    unavailable.
    
    This fixes issue #142.

    configure: Include sys/random.h before checking for getentropy on macOS
    
    This function is available since macOS 10.12, but it's in
    sys/random.h on macOS, contrary to the other platforms supporting
    it where it is present in unistd.h.
    
    If we don't include the right header that declares the function
    and its availability, the configure check would succeed even if
    targeting older versions of macOS that lacks the function.
    
    Also include the same header in the source file that actually
    uses getentropy.

    configure: Pass -no_weak_imports to the linker, if supported
    
    This avoids linking to functions that aren't available in the
    lowest targeted macOS version.
    
    If the proper header declaring a function is included, and
    gnutls is built with -mmacosx-version-min or the
    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable is set, each
    reference to a function that doesn't exist in the minimum
    targeted version will be made a weak reference, so that loading
    the binary still works, but the function pointer will resolve
    to NULL if running on a version of the platform that lacks it.
    
    Since this project doesn't do such runtime checks for functions
    it expects to have available, we should instead add this linker
    option to fail on the weak references. This allows autoconf to
    work as intended, detecting that these functions aren't usable.
    
    This flag appeared in Xcode 8, so check for its availability
    before using it. (Xcode 8 and the 10.12 SDK is coincidentally
    the release where most relevant new functions appeared, so with
    older Xcode versions, the modern platform functions we might want
    to avoid don't exist.)
    
    See issue #142.

    Previously, _gnutls_recv_in_buffers() silently discarded empty
    messages because such messages are used as a countermeasure to
    vulnerabilities in the CBC mode.  In TLS 1.3, however, there are only
    AEAD ciphers and such logic is meaningless.  Moreover, in the protocol
    it is suggested to send "unexpected_message" alert when receiving
    empty messages in certain occasions.  This change moves the empty
    message handling to record_add_to_buffers().

    "SHOULD" be 0 if the identity is a PSK username.
    
    This patch instead checks the key name of the ticket first and then
    check the constraints of the PSK username.  That way, it can
    distinguish tickets and PSK usernames in a more realible manner.

    certtool: use larger serial and CRL numbers
    
    Serial/CRL numbers can be up to 20 octets in length
    as per RFC 5280, so it should be possible to use
    such numbers as input to certtool. certtool
    only allowed to specify 63-bit numbers in
    template file or interactively (even though
    it generated larger numbers in batch mode
    by default).
    
    This patch allows large numbers to be specified
    as a hexadecimal string. Parsing of decimal numbers
    larger than native integers would require adding
    dependency on libgmp directly to certtool or
    extending the API exposed by GnuTLS library with parsing
    functions. Since most tools (including GnuTLS) display
    serial numbers in hexadecimal, it is not worth the
    trouble to support large decimal numbers.
    
    Default values are unified between batch mode and
    interactive input and their size is extended.
    
    CA/Browser forum recommends CAs to include at least
    64 bits of random data in the certificate serial
    numbers in Baseline Requirements[1] section 7.1, but
    gnutls adds only 32 bits. Some other
    implementations generate default serial numbers
    with more entropy as well, here is the current state
    as of May 2018:
    
    +----------------+-------------------------------+
    | Implementation | Random bits in default serial |
    +----------------+-------------------------------+
    | OpenSSL [2]    | 159                           |
    | CFSSL [3]      | 159                           |
    | wolfSSL [4]    | 128                           |
    | GnuTLS         | 32                            |
    | Mbed TLS [5]   | 0 (defaults to 1)             |
    +----------------+-------------------------------+
    
    The 20 octet field size can fit numbers up to 159 bits
    since the most significant bit must be zero as numbers
    in DER encoding are in two's complement and the serial
    and CRL numbers must be positive.
    
    Default serial numbers are extended to full 159 bits
    allowed by the field size and are completely random,
    which matches other implementations.
    
    CRL numbers have the same size requirements, but also
    need to be monotonic (RFC 5280, section 5.2.3). That's
    why timestamp is used in them. The timestamp portion
    is extended from 31 bits to 39 bits as 31 bits will
    overflow in year 2038. The rest of the available space
    up to 159 bits allowed in the 20 octet limit is filled
    with random bits.
    
    Since the new CRL numbers are larger, the requirement for them
    to be monotonically increasing is preserved when upgrading to a
    newer version. This does not hold the other way around though,
    so after using a newer version of certtool to generate a CRL
    with default number and publishing it, it's not possible
    to use older version anymore to generate subsequent CRLs.
    Unfortunately, there is no easy workaround for users of older
    certtool, since it is not possible to specify CRL numbers
    greater than 63 bits manually prior to this change.
    Users intending to downgrade to older version later are advised
    to specify the CRL numbers in new version of certtool
    manually with values they are smaller than what would get
    generated by default in the old version.
    
    grep does not recognize CRLF line endings generated
    in tests using MinGW, so we need to convert those to
    LF endings for $ in the regex to match test output
    correctly.
    
    datefudge 1.21 that is present in Fedora 26
    image trims the timestamp to 32 bits. That bug was
    fixed in datefudge 1.22 available in the Debian image,
    so we check if datefudge behaves correctly
    and skip the test that uses more than 32 bits if
    datefudge is broken.

    psk: mark psk_ke_modes as invalid when ignored
    
    TLS1.3 handles the receiving of pre-shared keys extension as
    invalid when the psk_ke_modes extension is not received as well.
    As such, when we ignore the psk_ke_modes for some reason (e.g.,
    no credentials) we need to indicate that it was received. We
    use the invalid mode flag for that reason, allowing the handshake
    to fail later for the right reason (e.g., no credentials error rather
    than illegal extension).

    ANON,SRP,NULL ciphersuites: when set do not negotiate TLS1.3 or later
    
    The reason is that these ciphersuites cannot be negotiated using TLS1.3.
    There is a different strategy followed for these.
    
     * NULL ciphersuites: they are not something normally enabled and used
       for debugging purposes mostly. When set both in client and server side
       only TLS1.2 can be used.
    
     * SRP ciphersuites: they are used on client side when the client is actually
       performing a username-password authentication with SRP. On server side we
       can have indeed a server support SRP and non-SRP. In that case we limit
       both on TLS1.2. That an unfortunate restriction, but is not a regression
       and IMHO these servers would most likely be phased out as very few would
       want to stick to TLS1.2 connections for SRP; or we may have an SRP update
       for TLS1.3 which could lift that limitation in the future.
    
     * ANON ciphersuites: they are used in certain client/server setups where very
       basic level of security is required, and in opportunistic encryption scenarios.
       There is a difference in the handling of these cases. In the case of Anon-only
       server/clients they provide the session with anonymous credentials structure; in
       the case of opportunistic encryption they provide both certificate and anonymous
       credentials. Thus we allow the protocol (TLS1.3) be in the priorities, but if we
       see no certificate or PSK credentials we disable TLS1.3 negotiation.

    priorities: disable any key exchange methods if there is no TLS1.2 or earlier
    
    That is, because TLS1.2 has specific requirements in the ordering of
    curves/groups if certain ciphersuites (ECDHE/DHE) are present, and
    by being able to eliminate them early we simplify the negotiation
    for TLS1.3-only clients/servers.

    That's very relevant under TLS1.3 as ciphersuite negotiation itself, where
    %SERVER_PRECEDENCE applied, does contain only the cipher algorithm and MAC
    unlike TLS1.2 which included key exchange as well.

    The abi-check target was updated to check against the last tag
    
    As abi-dumper and abi-compliance-checker tools are not reliable when
    run across different systems, we now compare the previous tag ABI with the
    current compiled library. That is in contrast with the previous behavior
    of storing the output files of abi-dumper, which can become obsolete on
    a CI update.
    
    That also moves the ABI check only on the CI, and not in the 'make dist' rule
    as it takes significant time to run.
    
    This relates to an issue reported against libidn2's use of abi-compliance-checker
    but it affects gnutls as they share similar code:

    ext/status_request: allow more than a single OCSP response to be received
    
    That change allows for arbitrary number of OCSP responses
    which is required in TLS1.3. The received list is now stored
    in auth structure, and thus packed with it on resumption data.
    The status response extension data, are now only used on server
    side, when temporarily storing the OCSP response to send.

    Removed:
     * Ciphersuites utilizing HMAC-SHA384. That MAC is only used on "legacy"
       type of ciphersuites, and doesn't provide any advantage over HMAC-SHA256.
     * Ciphersuites utilizing CAMELLIA were removed. TLS1.3 doesn't define any
       CAMELLIA ciphersuites, and thus provide consistent defaults across
       protocols.

    gnutls_*handshake: wrap gnutls_session_key_update under TLS 1.3
    
    The semantics of the gnutls_handshake() and gnutls_rehandshake() functions
    were tied to TLS 1.2 and earlier behavior. This patch attempts to merge
    the two different semantics as follows:
    
    TLS1.2:
     * gnutls_rehandshake: sends a hello request message (asks the peer for a re-handshake)
                           in server side; invalid to be called in client side.
    
     * gnutls_handshake: performs a re-handshake in either client or server side;
                         in server side it is expected to be called after
                         gnutls_rehandshake().
    
    TLS1.3:
     * gnutls_rehandshake: in server side sends a key update and asks the peer to re-key
                           as well; remains invalid to be called in client side.
    
     * gnutls_handshake: sends a key update and asks the peer to re-key as well;
                         in client side; is a no-op when called in server side.

    In addition it allows negotiating signature algorithms sharing

    versions (e.g., 6,4 maps to GNUTLS_SIGN_ECDSA_SHA512 under TLS 1.2

    DTLS: improved data MTU calculation under CBC ciphersuites
    
    The data MTU calculation under CBC ciphersuites takes into
    account that the overhead of these ciphersuites is constant (IV +
    hash + 1 byte padding), though the capacity varies due to the padding
    block. That is, on 16-byte padding block, one padding byte is the
    overhead but the rest 15 bytes are accounted for data MTU.
    
    That also has the side effect that setting a data MTU using
    gnutls_dtls_set_data_mtu(), is not definite, and the actual
    MTU may be larger for these ciphersuites --i.e., the
    return value of gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu().

    pkcs11: allow loading trusted modules when pkcs11 was initialized in manual mode
    
    When a PKCS#11 trust module is used in the system, but gnutls_pkcs11_init()
    is explicitly called with GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL flag, then the PKCS#11
    trust store was not loaded, and thus prevent any certificate validation.
    
    This change allows initializing the trust modules only even if generic
    PKCS#11 support is disabled by the application.

    Ensure the SNI extension is parsed during cache-based resumption
    
    This patch changes the parse_type of the SNI extension to
    GNUTLS_EXT_MANDATORY to ensure it is parsed during every handshake.
    
    With SNI previously classified as GNUTLS_EXT_APPLICATION, GnuTLS
    servers ignored the SNI extension when resuming a TLS session from
    cache, because "application" level extensions are skipped during
    resumption. As a result, gnutls_server_name_get() always returned
    GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE when called on the resumed
    session, breaking virtual server systems.
    
    According to RFC 6066, Section 3 the SNI extension must be parsed on
    session resumption if implemented at all:
    
      "A server that implements this extension MUST NOT accept the request
      to resume the session if the server_name extension contains a
      different name."
    
    This change allows applications using GnuTLS to match SNI data on
    resumed sessions.

    sign APIs: introduce RSA-RAW signing algorithm
    
    This ensures that there is a signing algorithm for all the operations
    we support. Previously, we required GNUTLS_SIGN_UNKNOWN to be acceptable
    by signing functions to accomodate for raw RSA operations. Now we make
    that explicit and in the process clean-up the API.

    cert selection: prioritize RSA-PSS certs over RSA
    
    RSA and RSA-PSS can both be used for RSA-PSS operations, and
    as such without prioritizing RSA-PSS certificates it is unknown
    which certificate will be used for an RSA-PSS operation. The
    reason we want to have only RSA-PSS keys used for RSA-PSS operations
    is to cover the use case where a server uses a legacy RSA certificate
    for clients that don't support RSA-PSS and an RSA-PSS certificate
    for the rest, thus separating the keys used for these client
    groups. That separation ensures that any issue on PKCS#1 1.5
    (legacy RSA), would not affect sessions which use RSA-PSS.

    gnutls_pk_params_st: separate flags/qbits and curve
    
    Previously we were using the field flags to store the
    size of q in case of GNUTLS_PK_DH, some key generation flags
    in case of GNUTLS_PK_RSA, and the curve in case of elliptic
    curve key. Separate this into multiple fields to reduce
    confusion on the field.

    gnutls_pk_params_st: renamed sign field to spki
    
    The name "sign" was ambiguous with regard to its intented
    use, as it could refer to digital signature parameters
    which was not exactly the case. That field contains parameters
    present in the subject public key info (SPKI), which could
    be used in a digital signature, but not necessarily.

    Clarified the purpose of the spki params related functions
    
    _gnutls_privkey_get_sign_params was renamed to _gnutls_privkey_get_spki_params,
    _gnutls_privkey_update_sign_params to _gnutls_privkey_update_spki_params,
    and the dig entry of gnutls_x509_spki_st was renamed to rsa_pss_dig.
    
    The reason is that there could be a confusion on the purpose of
    the 'dig' entry, as it could be assumed to be the signature's hash
    algorithm in the general case. That could not be because the SPKI
    parameters do not contain it for any other algorithm than RSA-PSS.
    As such, make a logical separation from SPKI reading functions
    with the signature reading functions and try to use the
    gnutls_sign_entry_st when signature information is required.

    Set a default supported curve
    
    RFC4492 and draft-ietf-tls-rfc4492bis-17 mention:
    "A client that proposes ECC cipher suites may choose not to include these
    extensions.  In this case, the server is free to choose any one of
    the elliptic curves or point formats listed in Section 5."
    
    As such, we set a default curve to be used in the case the
    server encounters a handshake with no supported groups/curves
    extension.

    The existing code was written with the intention of supporting multiple

    In addition, removed conversion of client provided server name (DNS) to

    priorities: share priority structures across sessions
    
    As the contents of the priority cache grows, it makes sense to shared
    these structures across many sessions (in server side) rather than
    copying them to a session. All overrides of the priority contents
    were moved to session->internals. On client side where gnutls_priority_set_direct()
    is more commonly used, ensure that the set priority is deinitialized.
    
    That also introduces gnutls_priority_set2() which does not copy the priority
    contents by default.

    OCSP: check the subject public key identifier field to figure issuer
    
    Normally when attempting to match the 'Responder Key ID' in an OCSP response
    against the issuer certificate we check (according to RFC6960) against the
    hash of the SPKI field. However, in few certificates (see commit:
    "added ECDSA OCSP response verification"), that may not be the case. In that
    certificate, that value matches the Subject Public Key identifier field
    but not the hash.
    
    To account for these certificates, we enhance the matching to also consider
    the Subject Public Key identifier field.

    tests: improved duplicate extension test
    
    Instead of sending two duplicate extensions of which one is invalid,
    send two valid ones instead. That way, we avoid the possibility of false
    positives due to the validation code of the extension contents.

    The new functions perform signing with input the signature algorithm instead

    is not used, or the public key algorithm may be different than the key's.

    x509: implement RSA-PSS signature scheme
    
    This patch enables RSA-PSS signature scheme in the X.509 functions and
    certtool.
    
    When creating RSA-PSS signature, there are 3 different scenarios:
    
    a. both a private key and a certificate are RSA-PSS
    b. the private key is RSA, while the certificate is RSA-PSS
    c. both the private key and the certificate are RSA
    
    For (a) and (b), the RSA-PSS parameters are read from the certificate.
    Any conflicts in parameters between the private key and the certificate
    are reported as an error.
    
    For (c), the sign functions, such as gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign() or
    gnutls_privkey_sign_data(), shall be instructed to generate an RSA-PSS
    signature.  This can be done with the new flag
    GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_RSA_PSS.
    
    Verification is similar to signing, except for the case (c), use the
    flag GNUTLS_VERIFY_USE_RSA_PSS instead of
    GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_RSA_PSS.
    
    From the command line, certtool has a couple of new options: --rsa-pss
    and --rsa-pss-sign.  The --rsa-pss option indicates that the generated
    private key or certificate is restricted to RSA-PSS, while the
    --rsa-pss-sign option indicates that the generated certificate is signed
    with RSA-PSS.
    
    For simplicity, there is no means of choosing arbitrary salt length.
    When it is not given by a private key or a certificate, it is
    automatically calculated from the underlying hash algorithm and the
    RSA modulus bits.

    gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2: treat signers with insecure algorithms as unknown
    
    The reason is that many servers utilize a legacy chain to improve compatibility
    with old clients and that chain often contains insecure algorithm. In that case
    try to construct alternative paths. To maintain compatibility with previous
    versions, we ensure that the same error code (verification status) is returned
    in these cases as before by sending the cached error if the alternative path fails
    too.

    Since ASN1_MAX_NAME_SIZE refers to a single element in the asn1

    This reverts commit c4842a21f65c7fc9a27932eb1792b1fc9e65f722.
    The time() syscall is also implemented as syscall() and is in
    fact performing better than gettime().

    Avoid deprecation warnings when including gnutls/abstract.h
    
    Since ac3de8f5, when all openpgp functionality was deprecated, a
    library user including gnutls/abstract.h gets warnings about
    deprecated declarations, like this:
    
    gnutls/openpgp.h:328:10: warning: ‘gnutls_openpgp_recv_key_func’ is deprecated [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
              gnutls_openpgp_recv_key_func func) _GNUTLS_GCC_ATTR_DEPRECATED;
    
    This warning is emitted since the gnutls_openpgp_set_recv_key_function
    prototype uses the deprecated typedef gnutls_openpgp_recv_key_func.
    
    By omitting the deprecation attribute from this individual
    typedef, we avoid the spurious warnings in calling code which just
    includes gnutls/abstract.h without actually using anything related
    to openpgp.

    Revert ".gitlab-ci.yml: include coverage statistics of FIPS140-2 code"
    
    This reverts commit 603772688c4e37dae437b4cede12e25b9dd9f678.
    The commit introduced a long wait for the coverage build without
    and significant benefit (the extend of the FIPS140 code is limited
    to have any impact on the overall coverage).

    rnd: switched to 3 chacha-based PRNGs for all security levels
    
    Chacha was selected because it is already present in TLS protocol
    as algorithm, meaning that re-using would improve CPU caching,
    and it is a comparable in performance algorithm to the existing
    PRNG used for nonces (salsa20). The yarrow generator was removed
    because we are primarily seeding from system devices which are

    Use a thread local random generator.
    
    This allows accessing the per-thread random generator in
    a lock-free way, at the cost of additional memory per thread.
    The default random generator imposes around 640 bytes per thread
    on 64-bit architectures.

    tests: Improve port-checking infrastructure.
    
    The test suite unnecessarily failed on systems without netstat because
    it was assumed to be present.  Instead of simply checking for its
    presence and indicating an unsupported test, however, the ss utility
    can be used as a drop-in replacement.  When netstat/net-tools is not
    present, the ss utility from iproute2 still stands a fair chance of
    existing, and they also have similar enough semantics that they can be
    used interchangeably in the test suite.
    
    The functions in tests/scripts/common.sh that used netstat
    (wait_for_port, wait_for_free_port) now use new functions,
    check_if_port_in_use and check_if_port_listening, to abstract the call
    to netstat/ss.  The eval'd variable GETPORT also used netstat, and has
    been updated accordingly.
    
    The new port-checking functions use another new function,
    have_port_finder, which takes care of the details of selecting ss
    (preferred) or netstat, or fails otherwise.

    When returning success, but no elements, gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url4,
    could have returned zero number of elements with a pointer that was uninitialized.
    Ensure that an initialized (i.e., null in that case), pointer is always returned.

    tests: do not run key-tests under leak sanitizer
    
    The reason is that we cannot distinguish between a memory leak on
    application failure (which is followed by exit- thus should be ignored)
    and an address sanitizer issue (which should never be ignored).
    As such we disable leak detection with asan and rely on valgrind.

    tpm: fix handling of keys requiring authorization
    
    There are several problems with the key handling in the tpm code.
    
    The first, and most serious, is that we should make sure we understand
    the authorization requirements of a key *before* using it.  The reason
    for this is that the TPM has a dictionary attack defence and is
    programmed to lock up after a certain number of authorization failures
    (which can be very small).  If we try first without authorization, we
    may lock up the TPM.  The fix for this is to check whether
    authorization is required and supply it before using the key.
    
    Secondly, if the key does require authorization but no password is
    supplied we should return immediately, since we know the TPM will give
    us an authorization error anyway.
    
    Thirdly, we should unconditionally read the policy of the key rather
    than checking if a policy exists: Policies are tied to key objects, so
    if there is an old policy in s->tpm_key_policy, but we're creating a
    new key, the key it belonged to will be closed, meaning the policy
    will be invalid.  Fix this by always setting the policy each time we
    get a new key object.

    Removed redundant certificate key usage checks.
    
    There were redundant checks when a certificate was obtained, as
    well as prior to performing operations with certificates/pubkeys.
    Kept the checks prior to operations.

    gnutls_kx_get: allow calling the function during handshake
    
    Previous this function would return garbage during handshake, because
    parameters were not considered established, however there are valid
    uses of this function during it. For that reason this function is
    modified to return a correct value even during handshake (after
    a hello is being exchanged).

    _gnutls_x509_get_dn: when no data ensure we return GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE

Date:   Fri Nov 11 16:20:01 2016 +0100

    Introduced new functions to allow multiple DN parsing modes
    
    The old DN parsing functions are changed to return the original
    non-fully compliant with RFC4514 string format, while the new
    ones return the compliant string by default. This allows applications
    which relied on the previous format to continue functioning without
    changes.

    tests: check for gnutls 3.3.x compatibility
    
    That is, check whether the status request extension is not sent
    by the server, if the server does not hold a status response. We
    require that behavior to be backwards compatible with gnutls 3.3.x.

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@gnutls.org>
Date:   Wed Oct 26 17:51:11 2016 +0200

    Reverted the behavior of sending a status request extension even without a response
    
    That is, we no longer reply to a client's hello with a status request, with
    a status request extension. Although that behavior which was introduced
    in 6b76e0c899b1ff08df9bd9b41588f771f050be89 is legal, it creates incompatibility
    issues with gnutls 3.3.x branch. That is because versions prior 3.3.26
    translates the presence of the extension as a guarrantee that the status
    response data will be sent. Even though, that is false assumption we
    replicate the previous behavior to allow such clients to connect to
    a gnutls 3.5.x server.

    While the change was fully backwards compatible for applications that were
    adding a single certificate, and applications that were checking for negative
    errors codes, many applications do not. As this may cause incompatibility issues
    with software properly utilizing the previously documented API, the change
    is reverted, and applications need to explicitly enable a flag (GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2)
    in the credentials structure for the set_key functions to return an index.

    DH: introduced gnutls_*_set_known_dh_params()
    
    That is, the functions gnutls_certificate_set_known_dh_params(),
    gnutls_anon_set_server_known_dh_params(),
    gnutls_psk_set_server_known_dh_params().
    These functions allow to statically set the DH parameters, based
    on the RFC7919 FFDHE parameters. This can simplify server configuration
    by allowing DH without loading parameters from file.

    priorities: Do read crypto policy files with mtime of zero
    
    In a default Fedora Atomic Host installation,
    `/etc/crypto-policies/backends/gnutls.config` is a symlink to the
    default in `/usr/share/`.  On an OSTree-managed system, files in
    `/usr` have an mtime of zero (to help deduplication).
    
    The simple fix here is to still try to read the first time, even if
    the file has an mtime of zero.

    That is, make sure that the API for stapling extensions is only used

    duplicate extension entries from the p11-kit trust database. These
    come from blacklisted certificates, and we have no reason to support
    stapled extensions with blacklisted certificates.

    The changes above allow setting a different OCSP status response
    file per certificate, and a different function. The indexes they
    rely on to associate with existing certs are the indexes returned
    by the gnutls_certificate_set_key() and friends functions.

    when setting corresponding data (e.g., an OCSP response).

    x509: Adjust IP name constraints behavior
    
    - Modified IPv4/IPv6 interaction in name constraints -- IPv4 and IPv6 no have empty intersection (previously: were treated independently).
    - Current behavior is more conservative -- in case of IPv4 constraint cert, subcerts will not be able to have IPv6 addresses.
    - Tests updated accordingly.

    Import DTLS sliding window validation from OpenConnect ESP code
    
    In this implementation, the end of the sliding window is always advanced
    to the latest received packet, and we accept up to 64 packets before
    that one. We no longer refuse to accept packets because they are
    *too* far ahead of what we've already seen.
    
    Some of the test cases are fixed up accordingly.
    
    This matches the code in OpenConnect esp-seqno.c at commit 314ac65.

    tests: Add tests for X509 IP constraints
    
    - Add dedicated test file name-constraints-ip for IP tests.
    - Test the following:
      * Generation and saving of valid name constraints.
      * Trying to save invalid IP constraints.
      * Reading the saved constraints.
      * constraints_check() calls for both IPv4 and IPv6.
      * IP constraints intersection (simple, empty, mediocre, complicated).
      * IPv4/IPv6 constraints interaction and various corner cases.
    - IPs/CIDRs are printed in logs in case of failure.
    - Add 2 new chain tests (positive, negative).
    - Add generated test executable to ignored files.

    x509: Add support for IP constraints
    
    - IP constraints are now checked against the subject alternative
      name field.
    - Implemented IP name constraints merging.
    - Added IP constraints validity checking during loading and getting
      the name constraints object from the user.
    - Add a convenience function name_constraints_node_new that allocates
      a name constraints node and sets its fields. Use this new function
      where applicable.
    - Add documentation for is_nc_empty, _gnutls_name_constraints_node_free,
      _gnutls_name_constraints_intersect.
    - Small improvements elsewhere (polishing).

    x509: Separate out IP handling functions
    
    - Moved IP/CIDR to string conversion functions into separate
      header and export privately for the use in tests.
    - Placed ip_in_cidr() into separate header for easy testing
    - Add publicly available function to convert text CIDR to RFC5280
      format for the use in name constraints extension.
    - certtool: Use GnuTLS exported CIDR functions instead of local ones.
    - Export mask_to_prefix, mask_ip for internal GnuTLS use.
    - Introduce new error value (malformed cidr) and add to description
      functions in errors.c.

    nettle: use rsa_*_key_prepare on key import
    
    Previously we calculated the size of the key directly, but
    by using the rsa_*_key_prepare we benefit from any checks that
    may be introduced in the future. Specifically any checks for invalid
    public keys (e.g., keys that may crash the underlying gmp functions).
    
    This patch avoids calling rsa_private_key_prepare every time we construct
    a nettle private key struct, because this function requires a bigint
    multiplication. We call that function once on private key import.

    x509: Fix DNS name constraints checking
    
    - If the intersection of name constraints of the given type was empty, the results allowed all names instead of none.
    - Fixed by adding an universal excluded name constraint in case the intersection for the particular type is empty.
    - Moved the logic of creating a name constraint node copy from _gnutls_name_constraints_intersect to name_constraints_intersect_nodes (previously name_constraints_match), as intersecting IP addresses will require further processing (not just taking one of the compared nodes as was the implementation till now).
    - GNUTLS_SAN_MAX added in order to comfortably iterate over SAN type enum.

    Added auto-detection of getrandom() system call in Linux systems
    
    In addition use getrandom() via the syscall interface if it doesn't
    exist in Libc. The reason for the latter is that getrandom() support
    for glibc is in limbo for several years, and for auto-detection is that
    even if it is going to be present in libc we will not be able to guarrantee
    that the system call is available just because it is present in glibc.
    For that we detect on initialization whether getrandom() can obtain
    random data, and if yes, we continue using that.

    tests: added checks for system priority file fallback mechanism

Author: Daniel P. Berrange <berrange@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 3 16:57:02 2016 +0100

    gnutls_priority_init: multiple @KEYWORD lookups with fallback
    
    The support for using "@KEYWORD" as a priority string is very
    useful to separate selection of priorities from application
    specific code or config files. It is, however, not general
    enough to fully serve all reasonable use cases.
    
    For example, consider an application sets
    
      gnutls_priority_set_direct(session, "@SYSTEM", NULL);
    
    The system administrator can modify the global priorities
    file to change what "@SYSTEM" resolves to for all apps using
    GNUTLS. As soon as one application wishes to have a slightly
    different configuration from others on the host, you have to
    go back and start modifying application specific configuration
    files once more. This is bad for the system administrator as
    it means there's no longer one single place where they can
    see the priority configuration for all apps.
    
    They may try to get around this problem by configuring the
    app to use a different keyword, instead of a full priority
    string, eg "@LIBVIRT". So the global priorities file can
    now define entries for both "SYSTEM" and "LIBVIRT". This
    has still placed a burden on the administrator change the
    config in two places - both libvirt config files and the
    global priorities file.
    
    What is more desirable is if applications were able to provide
    a list of keywords that would be tried in order, picking the
    first that existed. For example, libvirt could be written to
    request the following by default
    
      gnutls_priority_set_direct(session, "@LIBVIRT,SYSTEM", NULL);
    
    With this, gnutls would first try to find the "LIBVIRT" keyword
    in the global configuration file, and if that is not present,
    then it would fallback to trying to find the "SYSTEM" keyword.
    
    This provides nice "out of the box" behaviour for system
    administrators, whereby the app would be using "SYSTEM" initially
    and if the admin wishes to give the app a custom configuration,
    they can simply modify the global priorities file to add in the
    application specific keyword "LIBVIRT". There is never a need
    for the sysadmin to modify any application specific configuration
    files any more. It is exclusively controlled in one place via the
    global priorities file.

    _gnutls_resolve_priorities: always try to re-read sys priority file

        priorities: preload the system priorities on library loading time
    
    It is required to restart every application after changing the
    system priority file to get changes to take effect.
    
    Further, for applications running in a chroot, it will no longer
    honour a system priority file that may exist inside the chroot,
    always using the originally cached data from outside the chroot.
    
    This patch changes the caching so that we always try to reload
    the cache of system priorities. A mtime check is used to avoid
    actually re-reading the file unless its content has obviously
    changed. If the file no longer exists, the cache will not be
    invalidated. This ensures that the current priority file is
    always honoured, whether inside a chroot or not, while at the
    same time allowing apps to work in a chroot when no system
    priority file is present.

    _gnutls_check_key_purpose: in CA certificates treat the SGC key purpose as GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER
    
    This is a hack for certain very old CA certificates lurking around which instead
    of having the GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER have some old OIDs for that purpose. Consider
    these OIDs equivalent to GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER in marked as CA certificates.

    ocsp: attempt harder to figure an OCSP staple issuer
    
    That is, check initially against the trust list set on the credentials,
    and if verification is not possible attempt with all certificates in
    the chain as possible issuers. The reason of this enhancement is the
    few servers have an OCSP response signed not by their direct CA but
    rather by one of the higher level CAs.

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@gnutls.org>
Date:   Tue May 31 13:49:13 2016 +0200

    several sign-related API changes
    
    This replaces the usage of "int" in functions which could only
    have accepted an "unsigned" value. Also functions which return
    unsigned values are explicitly tagged as such. The ABI remains
    the same with these changes.
    
    This allows easier catching of sign/unsigned related errors from
    the calling applications.

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@gnutls.org>
Date:   Wed May 18 16:31:28 2016 +0200

    Write session keys into a file when GNUTLS_KEYLOGFILE is exported
    
    That is the file pointed from the variable is written to, and contain
    the session parameters in the following format (identical to NSS key
    log format):
    
    CLIENT_RANDOM <space> <64 bytes of hex encoded client_random> <space> <96 bytes of hex encoded master secret>
    
    and for the old RSA ciphersuites also in the format:
    RSA <space> <16 bytes of hex encoded encrypted pre master secret> <space> <96 bytes of hex encoded master secret>
    
    Resolves #64

    pkcs11: find_cert_cb: do not use C_FindObjectsInit() when another is already running
    
    While some modules implicitly terminated the previous run, this is not
    something that PKCS#11 modules are expected to typically do.

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@gnutls.org>
Date:   Tue May 3 09:28:36 2016 +0200

    pkcs11: the flag GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT will be respected by imported certificates
    
    That is, certificates imported with gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url() or
    gnutls_x509_crt_import_url() will be able to be extracted with their
    extensions overriden. Previously that was available only on gnutls_pkcs11_get_raw_issuer()
    and friends.

Date:   Mon May 2 15:36:56 2016 +0200

    tests: added a basic PKCS#11 mock module
    
    This is used to test gnutls_pkcs11_obj_get_exts(), gnutls_x509_crt_import_url(),
    and gnutls_pkcs11_get_raw_issuer() with the GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT

    instead of assigning a variable per flag use the init flags directly

    added flag in session to force sending a client certificate
    
    This handles the use case of a client connecting to a server
    which incorrectly lists the CA certificates it supports. Without
    that change the only option was to avoid using the "automatic"
    client certificate functions, but rather utilize callbacks.
    With that approach this use case is handled by the "automatic"
    certificate selection functions.

    Fix library build on Chrome Native Client (NaCl)
    
    Some supported toolchains define DT_UNKNOWN but do not
    define _DIRENT_HAVE_D_TYPE (and do not have the d_type field).
    On other platforms GnuTLS may need to second-guess what the
    library is reporting, but on NaCl this is unsafe.

    Updated false start support to be transparent to applications.
    
    That is, an additional flag GNUTLS_ENABLE_FALSE_START is introduced
    for gnutls_init(), and that enables support for false start. At
    this point false start will be performed by the handshake if possible,
    and gnutls_record_recv() will handle handshake completion.

    session tickets: avoid GCM for session tickets and rely on CBC and HMAC
    
    The latter is more resilient against non-key renewal.

    Broke apart _gnutls_recv_int() to the packet and non-packet cases.
    
    Only gnutls_record_recv_packet() called _gnutls_recv_int() with
    (packet != NULL). I refactored this logic directly downstream into
    gnutls_record_recv_packet(). The _gnutls_recv_int() function now only
    handles non-packet specific logic. The check_session_status() function
    was created to deduplicate common code which would otherwise have
    ended up in both functions.
    
    The rationale behind this change is to optimize what were previously
    calls of _gnutls_recv_int(). First of all _gnutls_recv_int() now has
    only 6 parameters, which according to the x86_64 System V Application
    Binary Interface should now fit into CPU registers and no longer use
    the stack. Secondly this change avoids a number of branching checks
    for both packet and non-packet cases.

    alpn: ALPN state is per-connection, it should not be saved with session data
    
    In addition the extension was moved to the mandatory to parse to ensure it
    is always parsed when sessions are resumed.
    
    rfc7301:
        Unlike many other TLS extensions, this extension does not establish
        properties of the session, only of the connection.  When session
        resumption or session tickets [RFC5077] are used, the previous
        contents of this extension are irrelevant, and only the values in the
        new handshake messages are considered.

    thus it is a good idea to avoid calling writev() and use sendmsg(). That
    way we reduce the number of calls required for seccomp.

    Do not allow importing public keys from PKCS #11 private keys for DSA and ECDSA
    
    This prevents the reading of the public key when non-RSA keys are available. This
    is a much cleaner approach than 5a4e692511dc3a829eda0d7c5a87e56cbc2055f0.

Date:   Mon Aug 24 12:00:10 2015 +0200

    Added simpler verification functions for clients
    
    The major use-case for the TLS protocol is verification of PKIX
    certificates. However, certificate verification support while is
    similar for almost all projects it requires around 100 lines of code
    (a callback) to be duplicated to all applications. That patch
    set gets rid of the callback and simplifies certificate verification
    support, by introducing a very simple API; one that would accept
    the session and the hostname only.

    Re-enable the certificate key usage checks for compliance with ciphersuite
    
    There is a new attack on the TLS protocol which relies on using certificates
    for ECDSA as certificates for ECDH ciphersuites. That attack while it doesn't
    affect gnutls, which doesn't support static ECDH, assumes that implementations
    ignore the key usage bits in the certificate. We have done it since 3.1.0 for
    compatibility reasons (see http://www.gnutls.org/faq.html#key-usage-violation),
    but that clearly opens the door for real attacks in the future.
    
    For this reason the key usage bits will no longer be ignored.

    When emitting binary-formatted output, send signature verification

    gnutls_pkcs11_obj_export3: allow operation when raw.data is NULL and we have a public key

    pkcs11: simplified export of objects
    
    That also allows to export public keys, even when a CKA_VALUE
    with the public key is not present. For that we use the key
    parameters, which we encode into a key. Issue reported by
    Frank Leavis.

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@gnutls.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 20 08:35:48 2015 +0100

    added gnutls_ext_set_data() and gnutls_ext_get_data()

    from union to void * pointer. That simplifies the exported API
    without reducing the options in the internal API.

    DSA signatures and DHE-DSS are disabled by default
    
    DSA was an algorithm that was never deployed on the Internet
    and had, until very recently, several limitations such as
    restriction of its keys to 1024 bits, SHA1-only etc. Given
    that there are literally 0 internet (HTTPS) certificates using
    DSA, there is no point to enable it by default and increase
    our attack surface.

    tests: Added test case for openpgp keys loaded by callback

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@gnutls.org>
Date:   Sat Jan 10 12:12:25 2015 +0100

    When setting up TLS with cert-type OpenPGP from a client,
    the server verifies if it supports the extension’s contents
    in _gnutls_session_cert_type_supported().  This function
    checks for cred->get_cert_callback but not cred->get_cert_callback2.
    As a result, servers setup for OpenPGP certificate credential
    callback with gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2() are
    unable to use the OpenPGP certificate type.
    
    The solution is to consider cred->get_cert_callback2 alongside
    cred->get_cert_callback in _gnutls_session_cert_type_supported().

    Don't call _gnutls_cipher_encrypt2 with textlen = 0 in _gnutls_auth_cipher_encrypt2_tag
    
    If the plaintext is shorter than the block size of the used cipher,
    _gnutls_auth_cipher_encrypt2_tag calls _gnutls_cipher_encrypt2 with
    textlen = 0. By definition _gnutls_cipher_encrypt2 does nothing in this
    case and thus does not need to be called.

    Handle zero length plaintext for VIA PadLock functions
    
    If the plaintext is shorter than the block size of the used cipher,
    _gnutls_auth_cipher_encrypt2_tag calls _gnutls_cipher_encrypt2 with
    textlen = 0. padlock_ecb_encrypt and padlock_cbc_encrypt assume that the
    plaintext length (last parameter) is greater than zero and segfault
    otherwise. The assembler code for both functions is automatically
    generated and imported from OpenSSL, so to ease maintenance the length
    should be validated in the functions that call padlock_ecb_encrypt or
    padlock_cbc_encrypt.

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@gnutls.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 21 16:10:33 2014 +0100

    The record version in the client Hello will be set to the lowest supported protocol
    
    There should have been no harm in keeping it SSL 3.0 but
    unfortunately in draft-thomson-sslv3-diediedie-00
    it has been marked as MUST NOT do that. That will be fixed in a later
    revision but since then there are servers not accepting SSL 3.0
    as a valid record version (note that this is about the record
    version, which describes the format of the packet, nothing to
    do with the negotiated version).
