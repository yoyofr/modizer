@table @code
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DISABLE_@-CA_@-SIGN
If set a signer does not have to be
a certificate authority. This flag should normally be disabled,
unless you know what this means.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DO_@-NOT_@-ALLOW_@-IP_@-MATCHES
When verifying a hostname
prevent textual IP addresses from matching IP addresses in the
certificate. Treat the input only as a DNS name.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DO_@-NOT_@-ALLOW_@-SAME
If a certificate is not signed by
anyone trusted but exists in the trusted CA list do not treat it
as trusted.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-ANY_@-X509_@-V1_@-CA_@-CRT
Allow CA certificates that
have version 1 (both root and intermediate). This might be
dangerous since those haven't the basicConstraints
extension. 
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-SIGN_@-RSA_@-MD2
Allow certificates to be signed
using the broken MD2 algorithm.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-SIGN_@-RSA_@-MD5
Allow certificates to be signed
using the broken MD5 algorithm.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DISABLE_@-TIME_@-CHECKS
Disable checking of activation
and expiration validity periods of certificate chains. Don't set
this unless you understand the security implications.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DISABLE_@-TRUSTED_@-TIME_@-CHECKS
If set a signer in the trusted
list is never checked for expiration or activation.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DO_@-NOT_@-ALLOW_@-X509_@-V1_@-CA_@-CRT
Do not allow trusted CA
certificates that have version 1.  This option is to be used
to deprecate all certificates of version 1.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DISABLE_@-CRL_@-CHECKS
Disable checking for validity
using certificate revocation lists or the available OCSP data.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-UNSORTED_@-CHAIN
A certificate chain is tolerated
if unsorted (the case with many TLS servers out there). This is the
default since GnuTLS 3.1.4.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DO_@-NOT_@-ALLOW_@-UNSORTED_@-CHAIN
Do not tolerate an unsorted
certificate chain.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-DO_@-NOT_@-ALLOW_@-WILDCARDS
When including a hostname
check in the verification, do not consider any wildcards.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-USE_@-TLS1_@-RSA
This indicates that a (raw) RSA signature is provided
as in the TLS 1.0 protocol. Not all functions accept this flag.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-IGNORE_@-UNKNOWN_@-CRIT_@-EXTENSIONS
This signals the verification
process, not to fail on unknown critical extensions.
@item GNUTLS_@-VERIFY_@-ALLOW_@-SIGN_@-WITH_@-SHA1
Allow certificates to be signed
using the broken SHA1 hash algorithm.
