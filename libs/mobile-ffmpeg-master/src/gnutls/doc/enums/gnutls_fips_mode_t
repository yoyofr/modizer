@c gnutls_fips_mode_t
@table @code
@item GNUTLS_@-FIPS140_@-DISABLED
The FIPS140-2 mode is disabled.
@item GNUTLS_@-FIPS140_@-STRICT
The default mode; all forbidden operations will cause an
operation failure via error code.
@item GNUTLS_@-FIPS140_@-SELFTESTS
A transient state during library initialization. That state
cannot be set or seen by applications.
@item GNUTLS_@-FIPS140_@-LAX
The library still uses the FIPS140-2 relevant algorithms but all
forbidden by FIPS140-2 operations are allowed; this is useful when the
application is aware of the followed security policy, and needs
to utilize disallowed operations for other reasons (e.g., compatibility).
@item GNUTLS_@-FIPS140_@-LOG
Similarly to @code{GNUTLS_FIPS140_LAX} , it allows forbidden operations; any use of them results
to a message to the audit callback functions.
