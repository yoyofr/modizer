@table @code
@item GNUTLS_@-KEYID_@-USE_@-SHA1
Use SHA1 as the key ID algorithm (default).
@item GNUTLS_@-KEYID_@-USE_@-SHA256
Use SHA256 as the key ID algorithm.
@item GNUTLS_@-KEYID_@-USE_@-SHA512
Use SHA512 as the key ID algorithm.
@item GNUTLS_@-KEYID_@-USE_@-BEST_@-KNOWN
Use the best known algorithm to calculate key ID. Using that option will make your program behavior depend on the version of gnutls linked with. That option has a cap of 64-bytes key IDs.
