.SH NAME
gnutls_credentials_set \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_credentials_set(gnutls_session_t " session ", gnutls_credentials_type_t " type ", void * " cred ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_credentials_type_t type" 12
is the type of the credentials
.IP "void * cred" 12
the credentials to set
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets the needed credentials for the specified type.  E.g. username,
password \- or public and private keys etc.  The  \fIcred\fP parameter is
a structure that depends on the specified type and on the current
session (client or server).

In order to minimize memory usage, and share credentials between
several threads gnutls keeps a pointer to cred, and not the whole
cred structure.  Thus you will have to keep the structure allocated
until you call \fBgnutls_deinit()\fP.

For \fBGNUTLS_CRD_ANON\fP,  \fIcred\fP should be
\fBgnutls_anon_client_credentials_t\fP in case of a client.  In case of
a server it should be \fBgnutls_anon_server_credentials_t\fP.

For \fBGNUTLS_CRD_SRP\fP,  \fIcred\fP should be \fBgnutls_srp_client_credentials_t\fP
in case of a client, and \fBgnutls_srp_server_credentials_t\fP, in case
of a server.

For \fBGNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE\fP,  \fIcred\fP should be
\fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
