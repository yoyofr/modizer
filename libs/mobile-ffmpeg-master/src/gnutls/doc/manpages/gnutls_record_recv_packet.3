.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a lower\-level function than \fBgnutls_record_recv()\fP and allows
to directly receive the whole decrypted packet. That avoids a
memory copy, and is intended to be used by applications seeking high
performance.

The received packet is accessed using \fBgnutls_packet_get()\fP and
must be deinitialized using \fBgnutls_packet_deinit()\fP. The returned
packet will be \fBNULL\fP if the return value is zero (EOF).
.SH "RETURNS"
The number of bytes received and zero on EOF (for stream
connections).  A negative error code is returned in case of an error.
.SH "SINCE"
3.3.5
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
