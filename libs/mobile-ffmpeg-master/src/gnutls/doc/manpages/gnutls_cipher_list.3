.SH NAME
gnutls_cipher_list \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Get a list of supported cipher algorithms.  Note that not
necessarily all ciphers are supported as TLS cipher suites.  For
example, DES is not supported as a cipher suite, but is supported
for other purposes (e.g., PKCS\fB8\fP or similar).

This function is not thread safe.
.SH "RETURNS"
a (0)\-terminated list of \fBgnutls_cipher_algorithm_t\fP
integers indicating the available ciphers.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
