.SH NAME
gnutls_fingerprint \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_fingerprint(gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " algo ", const gnutls_datum_t * " data ", void * " result ", size_t * " result_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algo" 12
is a digest algorithm
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * data" 12
is the data
.IP "void * result" 12
is the place where the result will be copied (may be null).
.IP "size_t * result_size" 12
should hold the size of the result. The actual size
of the returned result will also be copied there.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will calculate a fingerprint (actually a hash), of
the given data.  The result is not printable data.  You should
convert it to hex, or to something else printable.

This is the usual way to calculate a fingerprint of an X.509 DER
encoded certificate.  Note however that the fingerprint of an
OpenPGP certificate is not just a hash and cannot be calculated with this
function.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
