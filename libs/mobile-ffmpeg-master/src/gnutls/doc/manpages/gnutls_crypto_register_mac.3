.SH NAME
gnutls_crypto_register_mac \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/crypto.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_crypto_register_mac(gnutls_mac_algorithm_t " algorithm ", int " priority ", gnutls_mac_init_func " init ", gnutls_mac_setkey_func " setkey ", gnutls_mac_setnonce_func " setnonce ", gnutls_mac_hash_func " hash ", gnutls_mac_output_func " output ", gnutls_mac_deinit_func " deinit ", gnutls_mac_fast_func " hash_fast ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm" 12
is the gnutls MAC identifier
.IP "int priority" 12
is the priority of the algorithm
.IP "gnutls_mac_init_func init" 12
A function which initializes the MAC
.IP "gnutls_mac_setkey_func setkey" 12
A function which sets the key of the MAC
.IP "gnutls_mac_setnonce_func setnonce" 12
A function which sets the nonce for the mac (may be \fBNULL\fP for common MAC algorithms)
.IP "gnutls_mac_hash_func hash" 12
Perform the hash operation
.IP "gnutls_mac_output_func output" 12
Provide the output of the MAC
.IP "gnutls_mac_deinit_func deinit" 12
A function which deinitializes the MAC
.IP "gnutls_mac_fast_func hash_fast" 12
Perform the MAC operation in one go
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will register a MAC algorithm to be used by gnutls.
Any algorithm registered will override the included algorithms and
by convention kernel implemented algorithms have priority of 90
and CPU\-assisted of 80.
The algorithm with the lowest priority will be used by gnutls.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise a negative error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
