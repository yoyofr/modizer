.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_get_issuer \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_get_issuer(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " sc ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", gnutls_x509_crt_t * " issuer ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc" 12
is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
is the certificate to find issuer for
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t * issuer" 12
Will hold the issuer if any. Should be treated as constant.
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
Use zero or \fBGNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the issuer of a given certificate.
If the flag \fBGNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY\fP is specified a copy of the issuer
will be returned which must be freed using \fBgnutls_x509_crt_deinit()\fP.
In that case the provided  \fIissuer\fP must not be initialized.

As with \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer()\fP this function requires
the \fBGNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY\fP flag in order to operate with PKCS\fB11\fP trust
lists in a thread\-safe way.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.0
