.SH NAME
gnutls_hmac_fast \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/crypto.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_hmac_fast(gnutls_mac_algorithm_t " algorithm ", const void * " key ", size_t " keylen ", const void * " ptext ", size_t " ptext_len ", void * " digest ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm" 12
the hash algorithm to use
.IP "const void * key" 12
the key to use
.IP "size_t keylen" 12
the length of the key
.IP "const void * ptext" 12
the data to hash
.IP "size_t ptext_len" 12
the length of data to hash
.IP "void * digest" 12
is the output value of the hash
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This convenience function will hash the given data and return output
on a single call. Note, this call will not work for MAC algorithms
that require nonce (like UMAC or GMAC).
.SH "RETURNS"
Zero or a negative error code on error.
