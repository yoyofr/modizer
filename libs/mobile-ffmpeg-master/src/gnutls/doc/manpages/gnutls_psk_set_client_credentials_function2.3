.SH NAME
gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function2(gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t " cred ", gnutls_psk_client_credentials_function2 * " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_psk_server_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_psk_client_credentials_function2 * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the username and
password for client PSK authentication.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, gnutls_datum_t* username,
gnutls_datum_t* key);

This callback function has the same semantics as that of \fBgnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function()\fP,
but it allows non\-string usernames to be used.

The  \fIusername\fP and  \fIkey\fP \->data must be allocated using \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.
The  \fIusername\fP should be an ASCII string or UTF\-8
string. In case of a UTF\-8 string it is recommended to be following
the PRECIS framework for usernames (rfc8265).

The callback function will be called once per handshake.

The callback function should return 0 on success.
\-1 indicates an error.
