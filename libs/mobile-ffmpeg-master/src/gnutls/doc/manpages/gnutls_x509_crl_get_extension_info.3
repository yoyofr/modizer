.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_info(gnutls_x509_crl_t " crl ", unsigned " indx ", void * " oid ", size_t * " sizeof_oid ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_t crl" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crl_t\fP type
.IP "unsigned indx" 12
Specifies which extension OID to send, use (0) to get the first one.
.IP "void * oid" 12

a string in the provided buffer.  Use
\fBgnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_data()\fP to extract the data.

If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
* \fIsizeof_oid\fP is updated and \fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP will be
returned.
