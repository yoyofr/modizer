.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crq_set_spki \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crq_set_spki(gnutls_x509_crq_t " crq ", const gnutls_x509_spki_t " spki ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crq_t crq" 12
a certificate request of type \fBgnutls_x509_crq_t\fP
.IP "const gnutls_x509_spki_t spki" 12
a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure of type \fBgnutls_x509_spki_t\fP
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be zero
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set the certificate request's subject public key
information explicitly. This is intended to be used in the cases
where a single public key (e.g., RSA) can be used for multiple
signature algorithms (RSA PKCS1\-1.5, and RSA\-PSS).

To export the public key (i.e., the SubjectPublicKeyInfo part), check
\fBgnutls_pubkey_import_x509()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.6.0
