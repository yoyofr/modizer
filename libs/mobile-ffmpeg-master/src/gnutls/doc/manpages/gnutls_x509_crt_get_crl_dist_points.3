.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_crl_dist_points(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", unsigned int " seq ", void * " san ", size_t * " san_size ", unsigned int * " reason_flags ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP type
.IP "unsigned int seq" 12
specifies the sequence number of the distribution point (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)
.IP "void * san" 12
is the place where the distribution point will be copied to
.IP "size_t * san_size" 12
holds the size of ret.
.IP "unsigned int * reason_flags" 12
Revocation reasons. An ORed sequence of flags from \fBgnutls_x509_crl_reason_flags_t\fP.
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
will be non\-zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)

contained in the given certificate in the X509v3 Certificate
Extensions.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP and updates  \fIret_size\fP if
 \fIret_size\fP is not enough to hold the distribution point, or the
type of the distribution point if everything was ok. The type is
one of the enumerated \fBgnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t\fP.  If the
certificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified
sequence number then \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP is
