.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file2(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " sc ", const char * " response_file ", unsigned " idx ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " fmt ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc" 12
is a credentials structure.
.IP "const char * response_file" 12
a filename of the OCSP response
.IP "unsigned idx" 12
is a certificate index as returned by \fBgnutls_certificate_set_key()\fP and friends
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t fmt" 12
is PEM or DER
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function loads the OCSP responses to be sent to the
peer for the certificate chain specified by  \fIidx\fP . When  \fIfmt\fP is
set to PEM, multiple responses can be loaded.

This function must be called after setting any certificates, and
cannot be used for certificates that are provided via a callback \-\-
that is when \fBgnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function()\fP is used. In
that case consider using \fBgnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function3()\fP.

This function can be called multiple times when multiple responses
applicable to the certificate chain are available.
If the response provided does not match any certificates present
in the chain, the code \fBGNUTLS_E_OCSP_MISMATCH_WITH_CERTS\fP is returned.
If the response is already expired at the time of loading the code
\fBGNUTLS_E_EXPIRED\fP is returned.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, the number of loaded responses is returned,
otherwise a negative error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.1.3
