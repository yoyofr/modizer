.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2(gnutls_session_t " session ", unsigned int * " status ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a gnutls session
.IP "unsigned int * status" 12
is the output of the verification
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will verify the peer's certificate and store
the status in the  \fIstatus\fP variable as a bitwise OR of gnutls_certificate_status_t
values or zero if the certificate is trusted. Note that value in  \fIstatus\fP is set only when the return value of this function is success (i.e, failure 
to trust a certificate does not imply a negative return value).
The default verification flags used by this function can be overridden
using \fBgnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags()\fP.

This function will take into account the stapled OCSP responses sent by the server,
as well as the following X.509 certificate extensions: Name Constraints,
Key Usage, and Basic Constraints (pathlen).

Note that you must also check the peer's name in order to check if
the verified certificate belongs to the actual peer, see \fBgnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname()\fP,
or use \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_peers3()\fP.

To avoid denial of service attacks some
default upper limits regarding the certificate key size and chain
size are set. To override them use \fBgnutls_certificate_set_verify_limits()\fP.

Note that when using raw public\-keys verification will not work because there is
no corresponding certificate body belonging to the raw key that can be verified. In that
case this function will return \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) when the validation is performed, or a negative error code otherwise.
A successful error code means that the  \fIstatus\fP parameter must be checked to obtain the validation status.
