.SH NAME
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function(gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t         " cred ", gnutls_srp_server_credentials_function         * " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t         cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_srp_server_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_srp_server_credentials_function         * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's
SRP credentials.  The callback's function form is:

int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username,
gnutls_datum_t *salt, gnutls_datum_t *verifier, gnutls_datum_t *generator,
gnutls_datum_t *prime);

 \fIusername\fP contains the actual username.
The  \fIsalt\fP ,  \fIverifier\fP ,  \fIgenerator\fP and  \fIprime\fP must be filled
in using the \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP. For convenience  \fIprime\fP and  \fIgenerator\fP may also be one of the static parameters defined in gnutls.h.

Initially, the data field is NULL in every \fBgnutls_datum_t\fP
structure that the callback has to fill in. When the
callback is done GnuTLS deallocates all of those buffers
which are non\-NULL, regardless of the return value.

In order to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames,
if a user does not exist, g and n values should be filled in
using a random user's parameters. In that case the callback must
return the special value (1).
See \fBgnutls_srp_set_server_fake_salt_seed\fP too.
If this is not required for your application, return a negative
number from the callback to abort the handshake.

The callback function will only be called once per handshake.
The callback function should return 0 on success, while
\-1 indicates an error.
