.SH NAME
gnutls_privkey_init \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/abstract.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_privkey_init(gnutls_privkey_t * " key ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_privkey_t * key" 12
A pointer to the type to be initialized
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will initialize a private key object. The object can
be used to generate, import, and perform cryptographic operations
on the associated private key.

Note that when the underlying private key is a PKCS\fB11\fP key (i.e.,
when imported with a PKCS\fB11\fP URI), the limitations of \fBgnutls_pkcs11_privkey_init()\fP
apply to this object as well. In versions of GnuTLS later than 3.5.11 the object
is protected using locks and a single \fBgnutls_privkey_t\fP can be re\-used
by many threads. However, for performance it is recommended to utilize
one object per key per thread.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
2.12.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
