.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_tlsfeatures \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_tlsfeatures(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t " features ", unsigned int " flags ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t crt" 12
A X.509 certificate
.IP "gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t features" 12
If the function succeeds, the
features will be stored in this variable.
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
zero or \fBGNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND\fP
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
the extension status
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will get the X.509 TLS features
extension structure from the certificate. The
returned structure needs to be freed using
\fBgnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_deinit()\fP.

When the  \fIflags\fP is set to \fBGNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND\fP,
then if the  \fIfeatures\fP structure is empty this function will behave
identically as if the flag was not set. Otherwise if there are elements 
in the  \fIfeatures\fP structure then they will be merged with.

Note that  \fIfeatures\fP must be initialized prior to calling this function.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.5.1
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
