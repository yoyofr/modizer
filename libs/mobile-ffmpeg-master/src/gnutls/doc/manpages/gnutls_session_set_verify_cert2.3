.SH NAME
gnutls_session_set_verify_cert2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_session_set_verify_cert2(gnutls_session_t " session ", gnutls_typed_vdata_st * " data ", unsigned " elements ", unsigned " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a gnutls session
.IP "gnutls_typed_vdata_st * data" 12
an array of typed data
.IP "unsigned elements" 12
the number of data elements
.IP "unsigned flags" 12
flags for certificate verification \-\- \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_flags\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function instructs GnuTLS to verify the peer's certificate
using the provided typed data information. If the verification fails the handshake
will also fail with \fBGNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_ERROR\fP. In that
case the verification result can be obtained using \fBgnutls_session_get_verify_cert_status()\fP.

The acceptable typed data are the same as in \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_peers()\fP,
and once set must remain valid for the lifetime of the session. More precisely
they should be available during any subsequent handshakes.

If  \fIflags\fP is provided which contain a profile, this function should be
called after any session priority setting functions.
