.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * ext" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will export the features in the provided DER\-encoded
TLS Features PKIX extension, to a \fBgnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t\fP type.  \fIf\fP must be initialized.

When the  \fIflags\fP is set to \fBGNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND\fP,
then if the  \fIfeatures\fP structure is empty this function will behave
identically as if the flag was not set. Otherwise if there are elements 
in the  \fIfeatures\fP structure then they will be merged with.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a negative error value.
