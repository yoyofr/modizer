.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crl_get_signature_algorithm \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crl_get_signature_algorithm(gnutls_x509_crl_t " crl ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_t crl" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crl_t\fP type
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return a value of the \fBgnutls_sign_algorithm_t\fP
enumeration that is the signature algorithm.

Since 3.6.0 this function never returns a negative error code.
Error cases and unknown/unsupported signature algorithms are
mapped to \fBGNUTLS_SIGN_UNKNOWN\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
a \fBgnutls_sign_algorithm_t\fP value
