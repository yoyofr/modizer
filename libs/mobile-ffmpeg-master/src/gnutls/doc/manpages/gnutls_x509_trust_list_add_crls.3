.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t " list ", const gnutls_x509_crl_t * " crl_list ", unsigned " crl_size ", unsigned int " flags ", unsigned int " verification_flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list" 12
The list
.IP "const gnutls_x509_crl_t * crl_list" 12
A list of CRLs
.IP "unsigned crl_size" 12
The length of the CRL list
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
flags from \fBgnutls_trust_list_flags_t\fP
.IP "unsigned int verification_flags" 12
gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will add the given certificate revocation lists
to the trusted list. The CRLs in  \fIcrl_list\fP must not be deinitialized
during the lifetime of  \fIlist\fP .

This function must be called after \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas()\fP
to allow verifying the CRLs for validity. If the flag \fBGNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES\fP
is given, then the final CRL list will not contain duplicate entries.

If the flag \fBGNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES\fP is given, \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_deinit()\fP must be
called with parameter  \fIall\fP being 1.

If flag \fBGNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL\fP is given the CRLs will be verified before being added,
and if verification fails, they will be skipped.
.SH "RETURNS"
The number of added elements is returned; that includes
duplicate entries.
.SH "SINCE"
3.0
