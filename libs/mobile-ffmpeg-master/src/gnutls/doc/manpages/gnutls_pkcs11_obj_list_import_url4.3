.SH NAME
gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url4 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url4(gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t ** " p_list ", unsigned int * " n_list ", const char * " url ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t ** p_list" 12
An uninitialized object list (may be NULL)
.IP "unsigned int * n_list" 12
It will contain the size of the list.
.IP "const char * url" 12
A PKCS 11 url identifying a set of objects
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
Or sequence of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will enumerate all the objects specified by the PKCS\fB11\fP URL
provided. It will initialize and set values to the object pointer list ( \fIp_list\fP )
provided. To obtain a list of all available objects use a  \fIurl\fP of 'pkcs11:'.

All returned objects must be deinitialized using \fBgnutls_pkcs11_obj_deinit()\fP,
and  \fIp_list\fP must be deinitialized using \fBgnutls_free()\fP.

The supported in this function  \fIflags\fP are \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN\fP,
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN_SO\fP, \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRESENT_IN_TRUSTED_MODULE\fP,
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_CRT\fP, \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PUBKEY\fP, \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRIVKEY\fP,
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_WITH_PRIVKEY\fP, \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_CA\fP,
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_TRUSTED\fP, and since 3.5.1 the \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT\fP.

On versions of GnuTLS prior to 3.4.0 the equivalent function was
\fBgnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url2()\fP. That is also available on this version
as a macro which maps to this function.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.0
