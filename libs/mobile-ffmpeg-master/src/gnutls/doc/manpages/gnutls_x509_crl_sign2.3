.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crl_sign2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crl_sign2(gnutls_x509_crl_t " crl ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " issuer ", gnutls_x509_privkey_t " issuer_key ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " dig ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_t crl" 12
should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer" 12
is the certificate of the certificate issuer
.IP "gnutls_x509_privkey_t issuer_key" 12
holds the issuer's private key
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig" 12
The message digest to use. GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256 is the safe choice unless you know what you're doing.
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be 0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will sign the CRL with the issuer's private key, and
will copy the issuer's information into the CRL.

This must be the last step in a certificate CRL since all
the previously set parameters are now signed.

A known limitation of this function is, that a newly\-signed CRL will not
be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification), until it
is exported an re\-imported.

After GnuTLS 3.6.1 the value of  \fIdig\fP may be \fBGNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN\fP,
and in that case, a suitable but reasonable for the key algorithm will be selected.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
