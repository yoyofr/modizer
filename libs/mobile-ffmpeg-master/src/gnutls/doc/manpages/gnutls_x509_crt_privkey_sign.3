.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/abstract.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " issuer ", gnutls_privkey_t " issuer_key ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " dig ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t crt" 12
a certificate of type \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer" 12
is the certificate of the certificate issuer
.IP "gnutls_privkey_t issuer_key" 12
holds the issuer's private key
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig" 12
The message digest to use, \fBGNUTLS_DIG_SHA256\fP is a safe choice
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be 0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will sign the certificate with the issuer's private key, and
will copy the issuer's information into the certificate.

This must be the last step in a certificate generation since all
the previously set parameters are now signed.

A known limitation of this function is, that a newly\-signed certificate will not
be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification), until it
is exported an re\-imported.

After GnuTLS 3.6.1 the value of  \fIdig\fP may be \fBGNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN\fP,
and in that case, a suitable but reasonable for the key algorithm will be selected.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
