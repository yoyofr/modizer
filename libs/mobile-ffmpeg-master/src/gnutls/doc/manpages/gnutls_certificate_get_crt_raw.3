.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t sc" 12
is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "unsigned idx1" 12
the index of the certificate chain if multiple are present

The returned data should be treated as constant and only accessible during the lifetime
of  \fIsc\fP . The  \fIidx1\fP matches the value \fBgnutls_certificate_set_x509_key()\fP and friends
functions.
