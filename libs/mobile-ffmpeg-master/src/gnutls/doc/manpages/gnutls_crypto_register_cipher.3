gnutls_crypto_register_cipher \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS

.sp
.BI "int gnutls_crypto_register_cipher(gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t " algorithm ", int " priority ", gnutls_cipher_init_func " init ", gnutls_cipher_setkey_func " setkey ", gnutls_cipher_setiv_func " setiv ", gnutls_cipher_encrypt_func " encrypt ", gnutls_cipher_decrypt_func " decrypt ", gnutls_cipher_deinit_func " deinit ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t algorithm" 12
is the gnutls algorithm identifier
.IP "int priority" 12
is the priority of the algorithm
.IP "gnutls_cipher_init_func init" 12
A function which initializes the cipher
.IP "gnutls_cipher_setkey_func setkey" 12
A function which sets the key of the cipher
.IP "gnutls_cipher_setiv_func setiv" 12
A function which sets the nonce/IV of the cipher (non\-AEAD)
.IP "gnutls_cipher_encrypt_func encrypt" 12
A function which performs encryption (non\-AEAD)
.IP "gnutls_cipher_decrypt_func decrypt" 12
A function which performs decryption (non\-AEAD)
.IP "gnutls_cipher_deinit_func deinit" 12
A function which deinitializes the cipher
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will register a cipher algorithm to be used by
gnutls.  Any algorithm registered will override the included
algorithms and by convention kernel implemented algorithms have
priority of 90 and CPU\-assisted of 80.  The algorithm with the lowest priority will be
used by gnutls.

In the case the registered init or setkey functions return \fBGNUTLS_E_NEED_FALLBACK\fP,
GnuTLS will attempt to use the next in priority registered cipher.

The functions which are marked as non\-AEAD they are not required when
registering a cipher to be used with the new AEAD API introduced in
GnuTLS 3.4.0. Internally GnuTLS uses the new AEAD API.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise a negative error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
