.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the X.509 certificate's serial number.
This is obtained by the X509 Certificate serialNumber field. Serial
is not always a 32 or 64bit number. Some CAs use large serial
numbers, thus it may be wise to handle it as something uint8_t.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
