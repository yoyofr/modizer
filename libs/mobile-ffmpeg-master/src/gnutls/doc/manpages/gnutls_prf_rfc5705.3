.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "size_t label_size" 12
length of the  \fIlabel\fP variable.
.IP "const char * label" 12
label used in PRF computation, typically a short string.
.IP "size_t context_size" 12
length of the  \fIextra\fP variable.
.IP "const char * context" 12
optional extra data to seed the PRF with.
.IP "size_t outsize" 12
size of pre\-allocated output buffer to hold the output.
.IP "char * out" 12
pre\-allocated buffer to hold the generated data.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Exports keying material from TLS/DTLS session to an application, as
specified in RFC5705.

In the TLS versions prior to 1.3, it applies the TLS
Pseudo\-Random\-Function (PRF) on the master secret and the provided
data, seeded with the client and server random fields.

In TLS 1.3, it applies HKDF on the exporter master secret derived
from the master secret.

The  \fIlabel\fP variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose
for the generated data.

The  \fIcontext\fP variable can be used to add more data to the seed, after
the random variables.  It can be used to make sure the
generated output is strongly connected to some additional data
(e.g., a string used in user authentication). 

The output is placed in  \fIout\fP , which must be pre\-allocated.

Note that, to provide the RFC5705 context, the  \fIcontext\fP variable
must be non\-null.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.4
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
