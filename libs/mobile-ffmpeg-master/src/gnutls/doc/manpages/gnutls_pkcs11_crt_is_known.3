.SH NAME
gnutls_pkcs11_crt_is_known \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/pkcs11.h>
.sp
.BI "unsigned gnutls_pkcs11_crt_is_known(const char * " url ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * url" 12
A PKCS 11 url identifying a token
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
is the certificate to find issuer for
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
Use zero or flags from \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will check whether the provided certificate is stored
in the specified token. This is useful in combination with 
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_TRUSTED\fP or
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_DISTRUSTED\fP,
to check whether a CA is present or a certificate is blacklisted in
a trust PKCS \fB11\fP module.

This function can be used with a  \fIurl\fP of "pkcs11:", and in that case all modules
will be searched. To restrict the modules to the marked as trusted in p11\-kit
use the \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRESENT_IN_TRUSTED_MODULE\fP flag.

Note that the flag \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_DISTRUSTED\fP is
specific to p11\-kit trust modules.
.SH "RETURNS"
If the certificate exists non\-zero is returned, otherwise zero.
.SH "SINCE"
