.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", const char * " dn ", const char ** " err ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t crt" 12
a certificate of type \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP
.IP "const char * dn" 12
a comma separated DN string (RFC4514)
.IP "const char ** err" 12
indicates the error position (if any)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set the DN on the provided certificate.
The input string should be plain ASCII or UTF\-8 encoded. On
DN parsing error \fBGNUTLS_E_PARSING_ERROR\fP is returned.

Note that DNs are not expected to hold DNS information, and thus
no automatic IDNA conversions are attempted when using this function.
If that is required (e.g., store a domain in CN), process the corresponding
input with \fBgnutls_idna_map()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
