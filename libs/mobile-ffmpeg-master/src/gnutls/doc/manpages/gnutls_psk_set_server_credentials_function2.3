.SH NAME
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function2(gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t " cred ", gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function2 " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_psk_server_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function2 func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's PSK credentials.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const gnutls_datum_t* username,
gnutls_datum_t* key);

This callback function has the same semantics as that of \fBgnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function()\fP,
but it allows non\-string usernames to be used.

 \fIusername\fP contains the actual username.
The  \fIkey\fP must be filled in using the \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.

In case the callback returned a negative number then gnutls will
assume that the username does not exist.

The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
callback function should return 0 on success, while \-1 indicates
an error.
