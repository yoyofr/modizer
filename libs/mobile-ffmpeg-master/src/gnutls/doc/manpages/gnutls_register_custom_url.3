.SH NAME
gnutls_register_custom_url \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/urls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_register_custom_url(const gnutls_custom_url_st * " st ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const gnutls_custom_url_st * st" 12
A \fBgnutls_custom_url_st\fP structure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Register a custom URL. This will affect the following functions:
\fBgnutls_url_is_supported()\fP, \fBgnutls_privkey_import_url()\fP,
gnutls_pubkey_import_url, \fBgnutls_x509_crt_import_url()\fP 
and all functions that depend on
them, e.g., \fBgnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2()\fP.

The provided structure and callback functions must be valid throughout
the lifetime of the process. The registration of an existing URL type
will fail with \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP. Since GnuTLS 3.5.0 this function
can be used to override the builtin URLs.

This function is not thread safe.
.SH "RETURNS"
returns zero if the given structure was imported or a negative value otherwise.
.SH "SINCE"
3.4.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
