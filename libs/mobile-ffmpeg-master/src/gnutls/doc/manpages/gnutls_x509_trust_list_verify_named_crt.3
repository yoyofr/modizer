.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t " list ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", const void * " name ", size_t " name_size ", unsigned int " flags ", unsigned int * " voutput ", gnutls_verify_output_function " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list" 12
The list
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
is the certificate to be verified
.IP "const void * name" 12
is the certificate's name
.IP "size_t name_size" 12
is the certificate's name size
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.
.IP "unsigned int * voutput" 12
will hold the certificate verification output.
.IP "gnutls_verify_output_function func" 12
If non\-null will be called on each chain element verification with the output.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will try to find a certificate that is associated with the provided
name \-\-see \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt()\fP. If a match is found the
certificate is considered valid. In addition to that this function will also 
check CRLs. The  \fIvoutput\fP parameter will hold an OR'ed sequence of 
\fBgnutls_certificate_status_t\fP flags.

Additionally a certificate verification profile can be specified
from the ones in \fBgnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t\fP by
ORing the result of \fBGNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS()\fP to the verification
flags.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.0.0
