must be deinitialized afterwards using \fBgnutls_x509_crt_deinit()\fP
and the returned pointer must be freed using \fBgnutls_free()\fP.

The URI provided must be the first certificate in the chain; subsequent
certificates will be retrieved using \fBgnutls_pkcs11_get_raw_issuer()\fP or
equivalent functionality for the supported URI.
