.SH NAME
gnutls_record_send2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_send2(gnutls_session_t " session ", const void * " data ", size_t " data_size ", size_t " pad ", unsigned " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "const void * data" 12
contains the data to send
.IP "size_t data_size" 12
is the length of the data
.IP "size_t pad" 12
padding to be added to the record
.IP "unsigned flags" 12
must be zero
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is identical to \fBgnutls_record_send()\fP except that it
takes an extra argument to specify padding to be added the record.
To determine the maximum size of padding, use
\fBgnutls_record_get_max_size()\fP and \fBgnutls_record_overhead_size()\fP.

Note that in order for GnuTLS to provide constant time processing
of padding and data in TLS1.3, the flag \fBGNUTLS_SAFE_PADDING_CHECK\fP
must be used in \fBgnutls_init()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The
number of bytes sent might be less than  \fIdata_size\fP .  The maximum
number of bytes this function can send in a single call depends
on the negotiated maximum record size.
.SH "SINCE"
3.6.3
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
