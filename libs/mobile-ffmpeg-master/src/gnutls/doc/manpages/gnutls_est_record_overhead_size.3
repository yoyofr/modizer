.SH NAME
gnutls_est_record_overhead_size \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "size_t gnutls_est_record_overhead_size(gnutls_protocol_t " version ", gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t " cipher ", gnutls_mac_algorithm_t " mac ", gnutls_compression_method_t " comp ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_protocol_t version" 12
is a \fBgnutls_protocol_t\fP value
.IP "gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t cipher" 12
is a \fBgnutls_cipher_algorithm_t\fP value
.IP "gnutls_mac_algorithm_t mac" 12
is a \fBgnutls_mac_algorithm_t\fP value
.IP "gnutls_compression_method_t comp" 12
is a \fBgnutls_compression_method_t\fP value (ignored)
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be zero
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the set size in bytes of the overhead
due to TLS (or DTLS) per record.

Note that this function may provide inacurate values when TLS
extensions that modify the record format are negotiated. In these
cases a more accurate value can be obtained using \fBgnutls_record_overhead_size()\fP 
after a completed handshake.
