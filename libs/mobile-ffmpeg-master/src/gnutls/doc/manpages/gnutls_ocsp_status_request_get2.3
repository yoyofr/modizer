.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_ocsp_status_request_get2(gnutls_session_t " session ", unsigned " idx ", gnutls_datum_t * " response ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "unsigned idx" 12
the index of peer's certificate
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * response" 12
a \fBgnutls_datum_t\fP with DER encoded OCSP response
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the OCSP status response received
from the TLS server for the certificate index provided.
The index corresponds to certificates as returned by
gnutls_certificate_get_peers. When index is zero this
function operates identically to \fBgnutls_ocsp_status_request_get()\fP.

The returned  \fIresponse\fP should be treated as
constant. If no OCSP response is available for the
given index then \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP
is returned.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
.SH "SINCE"
3.6.3
