.SH ARGUMENTS

is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.IP "gnutls_server_name_type_t type" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is to be used by clients that want to inform (via a
TLS extension mechanism) the server of the name they connected to.
This should be used by clients that connect to servers that do
virtual hosting.

The value of  \fIname\fP depends on the  \fItype\fP type.  In case of
\fBGNUTLS_NAME_DNS\fP, a UTF\-8 null\-terminated domain name string,
without the trailing dot, is expected.

IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are not permitted to be set by this function.
If the function is called with a name of  \fIname_length\fP zero it will clear
all server names set.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
