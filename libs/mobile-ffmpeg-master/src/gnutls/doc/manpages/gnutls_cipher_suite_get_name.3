.SH NAME
gnutls_cipher_suite_get_name \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "const char * gnutls_cipher_suite_get_name(gnutls_kx_algorithm_t       " kx_algorithm ", gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t       " cipher_algorithm ", gnutls_mac_algorithm_t       " mac_algorithm ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_kx_algorithm_t       kx_algorithm" 12
is a Key exchange algorithm
.IP "gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t       cipher_algorithm" 12
is a cipher algorithm
.IP "gnutls_mac_algorithm_t       mac_algorithm" 12
is a MAC algorithm
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the ciphersuite name under TLS1.2 or earlier
versions when provided with individual algorithms. The full cipher suite
name must be prepended by TLS or SSL depending of the protocol in use.

To get a description of the current ciphersuite across versions, it
is recommended to use \fBgnutls_session_get_desc()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
a string that contains the name of a TLS cipher suite,
specified by the given algorithms, or \fBNULL\fP.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
