.SH NAME
gnutls_decode_ber_digest_info \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/crypto.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_decode_ber_digest_info(const gnutls_datum_t * " info ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * " hash ", unsigned char * " digest ", unsigned int * " digest_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * info" 12
an RSA BER encoded DigestInfo structure
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * hash" 12
will contain the hash algorithm of the structure
.IP "unsigned char * digest" 12
will contain the hash output of the structure
.IP "unsigned int * digest_size" 12
will contain the hash size of the structure; initially must hold the maximum size of  \fIdigest\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will parse an RSA PKCS\fB1\fP 1.5 DigestInfo structure
and report the hash algorithm used as well as the digest data.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
.SH "SINCE"
3.5.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
