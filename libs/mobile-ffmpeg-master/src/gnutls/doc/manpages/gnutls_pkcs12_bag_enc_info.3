.SH NAME
gnutls_pkcs12_bag_enc_info \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/pkcs12.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pkcs12_bag_enc_info(gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t " bag ", unsigned int * " schema ", unsigned int * " cipher ", void * " salt ", unsigned int * " salt_size ", unsigned int * " iter_count ", char ** " oid ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t bag" 12
The bag
.IP "unsigned int * schema" 12
indicate the schema as one of \fBgnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t\fP
.IP "unsigned int * cipher" 12
the cipher used as \fBgnutls_cipher_algorithm_t\fP
.IP "void * salt" 12
PBKDF2 salt (if non\-NULL then  \fIsalt_size\fP initially holds its size)
.IP "unsigned int * salt_size" 12
PBKDF2 salt size
.IP "unsigned int * iter_count" 12
PBKDF2 iteration count
.IP "char ** oid" 12
if non\-NULL it will contain an allocated null\-terminated variable with the OID
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will provide information on the encryption algorithms used
in an encrypted bag. If the structure algorithms
are unknown the code \fBGNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE\fP will be returned,
and only  \fIoid\fP , will be set. That is,  \fIoid\fP will be set on encrypted bags
whether supported or not. It must be deinitialized using \fBgnutls_free()\fP.
The other variables are only set on supported structures.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP if the provided bag isn't encrypted,
\fBGNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE\fP if the structure's encryption isn't supported, or
another negative error code in case of a failure. Zero on success.
