is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP type.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will delete all the CA name in the given
credentials. Clients may call this to save some memory since in
client side the CA names are not used. Servers might want to use
this function if a large list of trusted CAs is present and
sending the names of it would just consume bandwidth without providing
information to client.

CA names are used by servers to advertise the CAs they support to
clients.
