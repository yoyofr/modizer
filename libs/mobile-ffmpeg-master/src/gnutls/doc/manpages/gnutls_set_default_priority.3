.SH NAME
gnutls_set_default_priority \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_set_default_priority(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets the default priority on the ciphers, key exchange methods,
and macs. This is the recommended method of
setting the defaults, in order to promote consistency between applications
using GnuTLS, and to allow GnuTLS using applications to update settings
in par with the library. For client applications which require
maximum compatibility consider calling \fBgnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode()\fP
after this function.

For an application to specify additional options to priority string
consider using \fBgnutls_set_default_priority_append()\fP.

To allow a user to override the defaults (e.g., when a user interface
or configuration file is available), the functions
\fBgnutls_priority_set_direct()\fP or \fBgnutls_priority_set()\fP can
be used.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
.SH "SINCE"
2.1.4
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
