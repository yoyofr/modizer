.SH NAME
gnutls_verify_stored_pubkey \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_verify_stored_pubkey(const char * " db_name ", gnutls_tdb_t " tdb ", const char * " host ", const char * " service ", gnutls_certificate_type_t " cert_type ", const gnutls_datum_t * " cert ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * db_name" 12
A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the default)
.IP "gnutls_tdb_t tdb" 12
A storage structure or NULL to use the default
.IP "const char * host" 12
The peer's name
.IP "const char * service" 12
non\-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g. http)
.IP "gnutls_certificate_type_t cert_type" 12
The type of the certificate
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * cert" 12
The raw (der) data of the certificate
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
should be 0.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will try to verify a raw public\-key or a public\-key provided via
a raw (DER\-encoded) certificate using a list of stored public keys.
The  \fIservice\fP field if non\-NULL should be a port number.

The  \fIdb_name\fP variable if non\-null specifies a custom backend for
the retrieval of entries. If it is NULL then the
default file backend will be used. In POSIX\-like systems the
file backend uses the $HOME/.gnutls/known_hosts file.

Note that if the custom storage backend is provided the
retrieval function should return \fBGNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH\fP
if the host/service pair is found but key doesn't match,
\fBGNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND\fP if no such host/service with
the given key is found, and 0 if it was found. The storage
function should return 0 on success.

As of GnuTLS 3.6.6 this function also verifies raw public keys.
.SH "RETURNS"
If no associated public key is found
then \fBGNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND\fP will be returned. If a key
is found but does not match \fBGNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH\fP
is returned. On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
or a negative error value on other errors.
