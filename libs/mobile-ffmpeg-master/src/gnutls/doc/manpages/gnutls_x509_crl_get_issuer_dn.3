described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF\-8
encoded, depending on the certificate data.

If buf is \fBNULL\fP then only the size will be filled.

that is required see \fBgnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn3()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP if the provided buffer is
not long enough, and in that case the sizeof_buf will be updated
with the required size, and 0 on success.
