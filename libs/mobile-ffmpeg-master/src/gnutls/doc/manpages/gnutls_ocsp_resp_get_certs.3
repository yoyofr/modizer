.SH NAME
gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_certs \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_certs(gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t " resp ", gnutls_x509_crt_t ** " certs ", size_t * " ncerts ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_ocsp_resp_t\fP type
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t ** certs" 12
newly allocated array with \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP certificates
.IP "size_t * ncerts" 12
output variable with number of allocated certs.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will extract the X.509 certificates found in the
Basic OCSP Response.  The  \fIcerts\fP output variable will hold a newly
allocated zero\-terminated array with X.509 certificates.

Every certificate in the array needs to be de\-allocated with
\fBgnutls_x509_crt_deinit()\fP and the array itself must be freed using
\fBgnutls_free()\fP.

Both the  \fIcerts\fP and  \fIncerts\fP variables may be NULL.  Then the
function will work as normal but will not return the NULL:d
information.  This can be used to get the number of certificates
only, or to just get the certificate array without its size.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
