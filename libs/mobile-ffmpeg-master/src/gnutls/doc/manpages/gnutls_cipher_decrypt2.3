.SH NAME
gnutls_cipher_decrypt2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/crypto.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_cipher_decrypt2(gnutls_cipher_hd_t " handle ", const void * " ctext ", size_t " ctext_len ", void * " ptext ", size_t " ptext_len ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_cipher_hd_t handle" 12
is a \fBgnutls_cipher_hd_t\fP type
.IP "const void * ctext" 12
the data to decrypt
.IP "size_t ctext_len" 12
the length of data to decrypt
.IP "void * ptext" 12
the decrypted data
.IP "size_t ptext_len" 12
the available length for decrypted data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will decrypt the given data using the algorithm
specified by the context. For block ciphers the  \fIctext_len\fP must be
a multiple of the block size. For the supported ciphers the plaintext
data length will equal the ciphertext size.

Note that in AEAD ciphers, this will not check the tag. You will
need to compare the tag sent with the value returned from \fBgnutls_cipher_tag()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
Zero or a negative error code on error.
.SH "SINCE"
2.12.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.
