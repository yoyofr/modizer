.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", unsigned " indx ", void * " data ", size_t * " sizeof_data ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP type
.IP "unsigned indx" 12
Specifies which extension OID to send. Use (0) to get the first one.
.IP "void * data" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the data (may be null)
.IP "size_t * sizeof_data" 12
initially holds the size of  \fIdata\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the requested extension data in the
certificate.  The extension data will be stored in the
provided buffer.

Use \fBgnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info()\fP to extract the OID and
critical flag.  Use \fBgnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid()\fP instead,
if you want to get data indexed by the extension OID rather than
sequence.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached the
last extension available \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP
will be returned.
