.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_list_import2(gnutls_x509_crt_t ** " certs ", unsigned int * " size ", const gnutls_datum_t * " data ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " format ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t ** certs" 12
Will hold the parsed certificate list.
.IP "unsigned int * size" 12
It will contain the size of the list.
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * data" 12
The PEM encoded certificate.
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format" 12

.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be (0) or an OR'd sequence of gnutls_certificate_import_flags.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will convert the given PEM encoded certificate list
to the native gnutls_x509_crt_t format. The output will be stored
in  \fIcerts\fP which will be allocated and initialized.

If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509
CERTIFICATE", or "CERTIFICATE".

To deinitialize  \fIcerts\fP , you need to deinitialize each crt structure
independently, and use \fBgnutls_free()\fP at  \fIcerts\fP .
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise a negative error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.0
