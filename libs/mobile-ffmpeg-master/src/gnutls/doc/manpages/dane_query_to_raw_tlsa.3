dane_query_to_raw_tlsa \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/dane.h>

.BI "int dane_query_to_raw_tlsa(dane_query_t " q ", unsigned int * " data_entries ", char *** " dane_data ", int ** " dane_data_len ", int * " secure ", int * " bogus ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "dane_query_t q" 12
The query result structure
.IP "unsigned int * data_entries" 12
Pointer set to the number of entries in the query
.IP "char *** dane_data" 12
Pointer to contain an array of DNS rdata items, terminated with a NULL pointer;
caller must guarantee that the referenced data remains
valid until \fBdane_query_deinit()\fP is called.
.IP "int ** dane_data_len" 12
Pointer to contain the length n bytes of the dane_data items
.IP "int * secure" 12
Pointer set true if the result is validated securely, false if
validation failed or the domain queried has no security info
.IP "int * bogus" 12
Pointer set true if the result was not secure due to a security failure
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will provide the DANE data from the query
response.

The pointers dane_data and dane_data_len are allocated with \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP
to contain the data from the query result structure (individual
 \fIdane_data\fP items simply point to the original data and are not allocated separately).
The returned  \fIdane_data\fP are only valid during the lifetime of  \fIq\fP .
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBDANE_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
