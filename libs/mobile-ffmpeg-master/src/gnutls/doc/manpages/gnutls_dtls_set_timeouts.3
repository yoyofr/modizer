.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set the timeouts required for the DTLS handshake
protocol. The retransmission timeout is the time after which a
message from the peer is not received, the previous messages will
be retransmitted. The total timeout is the time after which the
handshake will be aborted with \fBGNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT\fP.

The DTLS protocol recommends the values of 1 sec and 60 seconds
respectively, and these are the default values.

To disable retransmissions set a  \fIretrans_timeout\fP larger than the  \fItotal_timeout\fP .
