.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Gets the certificate as sent to the peer in the last handshake.
The certificate is in raw (DER) format.  No certificate
list is being returned. Only the first certificate.

This function returns the certificate that was sent in the current
handshake. In subsequent resumed sessions this function will return
\fBNULL\fP. That differs from \fBgnutls_certificate_get_peers()\fP which always
returns the peer's certificate used in the original session.
.SH "RETURNS"
a pointer to a \fBgnutls_datum_t\fP containing our
certificate, or \fBNULL\fP in case of an error or if no certificate
was used.
