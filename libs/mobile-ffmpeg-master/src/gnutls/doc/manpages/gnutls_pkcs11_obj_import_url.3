.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will "import" a PKCS 11 URL identifying an object (e.g. certificate)
to the \fBgnutls_pkcs11_obj_t\fP type. This does not involve any
parsing (such as X.509 or OpenPGP) since the \fBgnutls_pkcs11_obj_t\fP is
format agnostic. Only data are transferred.

If the flag \fBGNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT\fP is specified
any certificate read, will have its extensions overwritten by any
stapled extensions in the trust module.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
2.12.0
