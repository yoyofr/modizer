.SH NAME
gnutls_range_split \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_range_split(gnutls_session_t " session ", const gnutls_range_st * " orig ", gnutls_range_st * " next ", gnutls_range_st * " remainder ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP type
.IP "const gnutls_range_st * orig" 12
is the original range provided by the user
.IP "gnutls_range_st * next" 12
is the returned range that can be conveyed in a TLS record
.IP "gnutls_range_st * remainder" 12
is the returned remaining range
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function should be used when it is required to hide the length
of very long data that cannot be directly provided to \fBgnutls_record_send_range()\fP.
In that case this function should be called with the desired length
hiding range in  \fIorig\fP . The returned  \fInext\fP value should then be used in
the next call to \fBgnutls_record_send_range()\fP with the partial data.
That process should be repeated until  \fIremainder\fP is (0,0).
.SH "RETURNS"
0 in case splitting succeeds, non zero in case of error.
Note that  \fIorig\fP is not changed, while the values of  \fInext\fP and  \fIremainder\fP are modified to store the resulting values.
