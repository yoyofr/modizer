.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will allocate buffer and copy the name of the CRL issuer.
The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as
described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF\-8
encoded, depending on the certificate data.

format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions of GnuTLS
which was not not fully RFC4514\-compliant.
