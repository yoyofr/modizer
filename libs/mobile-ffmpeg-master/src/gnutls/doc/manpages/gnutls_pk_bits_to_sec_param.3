.SH NAME
gnutls_pk_bits_to_sec_param \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "gnutls_sec_param_t gnutls_pk_bits_to_sec_param(gnutls_pk_algorithm_t " algo ", unsigned int " bits ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pk_algorithm_t algo" 12
is a public key algorithm
.IP "unsigned int bits" 12
is the number of bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the inverse of \fBgnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits()\fP. Given an algorithm
and the number of bits, it will return the security parameter. This is
a rough indication.
.SH "RETURNS"
The security parameter.
