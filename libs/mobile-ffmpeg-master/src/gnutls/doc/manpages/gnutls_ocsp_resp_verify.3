.SH NAME
gnutls_ocsp_resp_verify \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/ocsp.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_ocsp_resp_verify(gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t " resp ", gnutls_x509_trust_list_t " trustlist ", unsigned int * " verify ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_ocsp_resp_const_t resp" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_ocsp_resp_t\fP type
.IP "gnutls_x509_trust_list_t trustlist" 12
trust anchors as a \fBgnutls_x509_trust_list_t\fP type
.IP "unsigned int * verify" 12
output variable with verification status, an \fBgnutls_ocsp_verify_reason_t\fP
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
verification flags from \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_flags\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Verify signature of the Basic OCSP Response against the public key
in the certificate of a trusted signer.  The  \fItrustlist\fP should be
populated with trust anchors.  The function will extract the signer
certificate from the Basic OCSP Response and will verify it against
the  \fItrustlist\fP .  A trusted signer is a certificate that is either
in  \fItrustlist\fP , or it is signed directly by a certificate in
 \fItrustlist\fP and has the id\-ad\-ocspSigning Extended Key Usage bit
set.

The output  \fIverify\fP variable will hold verification status codes
(e.g., \fBGNUTLS_OCSP_VERIFY_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND\fP,
\fBGNUTLS_OCSP_VERIFY_INSECURE_ALGORITHM\fP) which are only valid if the
function returned \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP.

Note that the function returns \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP even when
verification failed.  The caller must always inspect the  \fIverify\fP variable to find out the verification status.

The  \fIflags\fP variable should be 0 for now.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
