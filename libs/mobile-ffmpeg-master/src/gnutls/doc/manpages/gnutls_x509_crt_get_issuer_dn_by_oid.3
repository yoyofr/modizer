.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn_by_oid \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", const char * " oid ", unsigned " indx ", unsigned int " raw_flag ", void * " buf ", size_t * " buf_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP type
.IP "const char * oid" 12
holds an Object Identified in null terminated string
.IP "unsigned indx" 12
In case multiple same OIDs exist in the RDN, this specifies which to send. Use (0) to get the first one.
.IP "unsigned int raw_flag" 12
If non\-zero returns the raw DER data of the DN part.
.IP "void * buf" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be null)
.IP "size_t * buf_size" 12
initially holds the size of  \fIbuf\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will extract the part of the name of the Certificate
issuer specified by the given OID. The output, if the raw flag is not
used, will be encoded as described in RFC4514. Thus a string that is
ASCII or UTF\-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
If raw flag is (0), this function will only return known OIDs as
text. Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described in RFC4514 \-\-
in hex format with a '#' prefix.  You can check about known OIDs
using \fBgnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()\fP.

If  \fIbuf\fP is null then only the size will be filled. If the  \fIraw_flag\fP is not specified the output is always null terminated, although the
 \fIbuf_size\fP will not include the null character.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP if the provided buffer is not
long enough, and in that case the  \fIbuf_size\fP will be updated with
the required size. \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP if there
are no data in the current index. On success 0 is returned.
