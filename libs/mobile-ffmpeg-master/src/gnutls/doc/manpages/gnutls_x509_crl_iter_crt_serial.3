.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial(gnutls_x509_crl_t " crl ", gnutls_x509_crl_iter_t * " iter ", unsigned char * " serial ", size_t * " serial_size ", time_t * " t ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_t crl" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crl_t\fP type
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_iter_t * iter" 12
A pointer to an iterator (initially the iterator should be \fBNULL\fP)
.IP "unsigned char * serial" 12
where the serial number will be copied
.IP "size_t * serial_size" 12
initially holds the size of serial
.IP "time_t * t" 12
if non null, will hold the time this certificate was revoked
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function performs the same as \fBgnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial()\fP,
but reads sequentially and keeps state in the iterator 
between calls. That allows it to provide better performance in sequences 
with many elements (50000+).

When past the last element is accessed \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP
is returned and the iterator is reset.

After use, the iterator must be deinitialized using \fBgnutls_x509_crl_iter_deinit()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
