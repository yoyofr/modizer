This function will set the maximum transfer unit of the transport
that DTLS packets are sent over. Note that this should exclude
the IP (or IPv6) and UDP headers. So for DTLS over IPv6 on an
Ethernet device with MTU 1500, the DTLS MTU set with this function
would be 1500 \- 40 (IPV6 header) \- 8 (UDP header) = 1452.
