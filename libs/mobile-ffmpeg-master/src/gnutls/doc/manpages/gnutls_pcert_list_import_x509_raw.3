.SH NAME
gnutls_pcert_list_import_x509_raw \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/abstract.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pcert_list_import_x509_raw(gnutls_pcert_st * " pcert_list ", unsigned int * " pcert_list_size ", const gnutls_datum_t * " data ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " format ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list" 12
The structures to store the certificates; must not contain initialized \fBgnutls_pcert_st\fP structures.
.IP "unsigned int * pcert_list_size" 12
Initially must hold the maximum number of certs. It will be updated with the number of certs available.
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * data" 12
The certificates.
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format" 12
One of DER or PEM.
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be (0) or an OR'd sequence of gnutls_certificate_import_flags.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will import the provided DER or PEM encoded certificates to an
already allocated set of \fBgnutls_pcert_st\fP structures. The structures must
be deinitialized afterwards using \fBgnutls_pcert_deinit()\fP.  \fIpcert_list\fP should contain space for at least  \fIpcert_list_size\fP elements.

If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509
CERTIFICATE", or "CERTIFICATE".
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value; if the  \fIpcert\fP list doesn't have enough space
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP will be returned.
.SH "SINCE"
