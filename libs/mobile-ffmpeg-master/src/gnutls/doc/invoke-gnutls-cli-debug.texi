TLS debug client. It sets up multiple TLS connections to 
a server and queries its capabilities. It was created to assist in debugging 
GnuTLS, but it might be useful to extract a TLS server's capabilities.
It connects to a TLS server, performs tests and print the server's 
capabilities. If called with the `-V' parameter more checks will be performed.
Can be used to check for servers with special needs or bugs.

@cindex gnutls-cli-debug help

This is the automatically generated usage text for gnutls-cli-debug.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.

Options are specified by doubled hyphens and their name or by a single
hyphen and the flag character.
Operands and options may be intermixed.  They will be reordered.

@anchor{gnutls-cli-debug debug}
@subheading debug option (-d)

This is the ``enable debugging'' option.
This option takes a number argument.
Specifies the debug level.
@anchor{gnutls-cli-debug app-proto}
@subheading app-proto option

This is an alias for the @code{starttls-proto} option,
@pxref{gnutls-cli-debug starttls-proto, the starttls-proto option documentation}.

@anchor{gnutls-cli-debug starttls-proto}
@subheading starttls-proto option

This is the ``the application protocol to be used to obtain the server's certificate (https, ftp, smtp, imap, ldap, xmpp, lmtp, pop3, nntp, sieve, postgres)'' option.
This option takes a string argument.
Specify the application layer protocol for STARTTLS. If the protocol is supported, gnutls-cli will proceed to the TLS negotiation.
@anchor{gnutls-cli-debug exit status}
@subheading gnutls-cli-debug exit status

One of the following exit values will be returned:
@table @samp
@item 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
Successful program execution.
@item 1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

You could also use the client to debug services with starttls capability.
@example
$ gnutls-cli-debug --starttls-proto smtp --port 25 localhost
