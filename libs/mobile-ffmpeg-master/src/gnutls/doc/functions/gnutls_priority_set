@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_priority_set} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, gnutls_priority_t @var{priority})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{priority}: is a @code{gnutls_priority_t}  type.

Sets the priorities to use on the ciphers, key exchange methods,
and macs. Note that this function is expected to be called once
per session; when called multiple times (e.g., before a re-handshake,
the caller should make sure that any new settings are not incompatible
with the original session).

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  on success, or an error code on error.
