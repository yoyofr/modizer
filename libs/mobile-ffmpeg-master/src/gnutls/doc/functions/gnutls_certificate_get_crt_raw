@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_certificate_get_crt_raw} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{sc}, unsigned @var{idx1}, unsigned @var{idx2}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{cert})
@var{sc}: is a @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t}  type.

@var{idx1}: the index of the certificate chain if multiple are present

@var{idx2}: the index of the certificate in the chain. Zero gives the server's certificate.

@var{cert}: Will hold the DER encoded certificate.

This function will return the DER encoded certificate of the
server or any other certificate on its certificate chain (based on  @code{idx2} ).
The returned data should be treated as constant and only accessible during the lifetime
of  @code{sc} . The  @code{idx1} matches the value @code{gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key()}  and friends
functions.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value. In case the indexes are out of bounds @code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE} 
is returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.2.5
