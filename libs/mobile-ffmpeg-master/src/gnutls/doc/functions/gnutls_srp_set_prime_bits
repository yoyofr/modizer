@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_srp_set_prime_bits} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned int @var{bits})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{bits}: is the number of bits

This function sets the minimum accepted number of bits, for use in
an SRP key exchange.  If zero, the default 2048 bits will be used.

In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.  If
a server sends a prime with less bits than that
@code{GNUTLS_E_RECEIVED_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER}  will be returned by the
handshake.

This function has no effect in server side.
