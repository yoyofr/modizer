@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava} (gnutls_x509_dn_t @var{dn}, int @var{irdn}, int @var{iava}, gnutls_x509_ava_st * @var{ava})
@var{dn}: a pointer to DN

@var{irdn}: index of RDN

@var{iava}: index of AVA.

@var{ava}: Pointer to structure which will hold output information.

Get pointers to data within the DN. The format of the  @code{ava} structure
is shown below.

struct gnutls_x509_ava_st @{
gnutls_datum_t oid;
gnutls_datum_t value;
unsigned long value_tag;
@};

The X.509 distinguished name is a sequence of sequences of strings
and this is what the  @code{irdn} and  @code{iava} indexes model.

Note that  @code{ava} will contain pointers into the  @code{dn} structure which
in turns points to the original certificate. Thus you should not
modify any data or deallocate any of those.

This is a low-level function that requires the caller to do the
value conversions when necessary (e.g. from UCS-2).

@strong{Returns:} Returns 0 on success, or an error code.
