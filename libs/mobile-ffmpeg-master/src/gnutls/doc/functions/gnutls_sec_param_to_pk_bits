@deftypefun {unsigned int} {gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits} (gnutls_pk_algorithm_t @var{algo}, gnutls_sec_param_t @var{param})
@var{algo}: is a public key algorithm

@var{param}: is a security parameter

When generating private and public key pairs a difficult question
is which size of "bits" the modulus will be in RSA and the group size
in DSA. The easy answer is 1024, which is also wrong. This function
will convert a human understandable security parameter to an
appropriate size for the specific algorithm.

@strong{Returns:} The number of bits, or (0).

@strong{Since:} 2.12.0
