@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_range_split} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, const gnutls_range_st * @var{orig}, gnutls_range_st * @var{next}, gnutls_range_st * @var{remainder})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type

@var{orig}: is the original range provided by the user

@var{next}: is the returned range that can be conveyed in a TLS record

@var{remainder}: is the returned remaining range

This function should be used when it is required to hide the length
of very long data that cannot be directly provided to @code{gnutls_record_send_range()} .
In that case this function should be called with the desired length
hiding range in  @code{orig} . The returned  @code{next} value should then be used in
the next call to @code{gnutls_record_send_range()}  with the partial data.
That process should be repeated until  @code{remainder} is (0,0).

@strong{Returns:} 0 in case splitting succeeds, non zero in case of error.
Note that  @code{orig} is not changed, while the values of  @code{next} and  @code{remainder} are modified to store the resulting values.
