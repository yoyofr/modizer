@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_idna_map} (const char * @var{input}, unsigned @var{ilen}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{out}, unsigned @var{flags})
@var{input}: contain the UTF-8 formatted domain name

@var{ilen}: the length of the provided string

@var{out}: the result in an null-terminated allocated string

@var{flags}: should be zero

This function will convert the provided UTF-8 domain name, to
its IDNA mapping in an allocated variable. Note that depending on the flags the used gnutls
library was compiled with, the output of this function may vary (i.e.,
may be IDNA2008, or IDNA2003).

To force IDNA2008 specify the flag @code{GNUTLS_IDNA_FORCE_2008} . In
the case GnuTLS is not compiled with the necessary dependencies,
@code{GNUTLS_E_UNIMPLEMENTED_FEATURE}  will be returned to indicate that
gnutls is unable to perform the requested conversion.

Note also, that this function will return an empty string if an
empty string is provided as input.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_INVALID_UTF8_STRING}  on invalid UTF-8 data, or 0 on success.

@strong{Since:} 3.5.8
