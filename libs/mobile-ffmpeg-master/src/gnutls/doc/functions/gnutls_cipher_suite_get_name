@var{kx_algorithm}: is a Key exchange algorithm

@var{cipher_algorithm}: is a cipher algorithm

@var{mac_algorithm}: is a MAC algorithm

This function returns the ciphersuite name under TLS1.2 or earlier
versions when provided with individual algorithms. The full cipher suite
name must be prepended by TLS or SSL depending of the protocol in use.

To get a description of the current ciphersuite across versions, it
is recommended to use @code{gnutls_session_get_desc()} .

@strong{Returns:} a string that contains the name of a TLS cipher suite,
specified by the given algorithms, or @code{NULL} .
