@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_pkcs11_init} (unsigned int @var{flags}, const char * @var{deprecated_config_file})
@var{flags}: An ORed sequence of @code{GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_} *

@var{deprecated_config_file}: either NULL or the location of a deprecated
configuration file

This function will initialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls. It will
read configuration files if @code{GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO}  is used or allow
you to independently load PKCS 11 modules using @code{gnutls_pkcs11_add_provider()} 
if @code{GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL}  is specified.

You don't need to call this function since GnuTLS 3.3.0 because it is being called
during the first request PKCS 11 operation. That call will assume the @code{GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO} 
flag. If another flags are required then it must be called independently
prior to any PKCS 11 operation.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.

@strong{Since:} 2.12.0
