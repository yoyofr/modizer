@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_transport_set_errno} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, int @var{err})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{err}: error value to store in session-specific errno variable.

Store  @code{err} in the session-specific errno variable.  Useful values
for  @code{err} are EINTR, EAGAIN and EMSGSIZE, other values are treated will be
treated as real errors in the push/pull function.

This function is useful in replacement push and pull functions set by
@code{gnutls_transport_set_push_function()}  and
@code{gnutls_transport_set_pull_function()}  under Windows, where the
replacements may not have access to the same  @code{errno} variable that is used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to
msvcr71.dll and gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).

This function is unreliable if you are using the same
 @code{session} in different threads for sending and receiving.
