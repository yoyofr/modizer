@deftypefun {gnutls_certificate_type_t} {gnutls_certificate_type_get} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

This function returns the type of the certificate that is negotiated
for this side to send to the peer. The certificate type is by default
X.509, unless an alternative certificate type is enabled by
@code{gnutls_init()}  and negotiated during the session.

Resumed sessions will return the certificate type that was negotiated
and used in the original session.

As of version 3.6.4 it is recommended to use
@code{gnutls_certificate_type_get2()}  which is more fine-grained.

@strong{Returns:} the currently used @code{gnutls_certificate_type_t}  certificate
type as negotiated for 'our' side of the connection.
