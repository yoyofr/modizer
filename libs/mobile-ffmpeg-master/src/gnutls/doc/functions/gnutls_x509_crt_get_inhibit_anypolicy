@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_get_inhibit_anypolicy} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, unsigned int * @var{skipcerts}, unsigned int * @var{critical})
@var{cert}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t}  type

@var{skipcerts}: will hold the number of certificates after which anypolicy is no longer acceptable.

@var{critical}: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

This function will return certificate's value of the SkipCerts, i.e.,
the Inhibit anyPolicy X.509 extension (2.5.29.54).

The returned value is the number of additional certificates that
may appear in the path before the anyPolicy is no longer acceptable.

@strong{Returns:} zero on success, or a negative error code in case of
parsing error.  If the certificate does not contain the Inhibit anyPolicy
extension @code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE}  will be
returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.6.0
