@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_init} (gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t * @var{key})
@var{key}: A pointer to the type to be initialized

This function will initialize an private key structure. This
structure can be used for accessing an underlying PKCS@code{11}  object.

In versions of GnuTLS later than 3.5.11 the object is protected
using locks and a single @code{gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t}  can be re-used
by many threads. However, for performance it is recommended to utilize
one object per key per thread.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
