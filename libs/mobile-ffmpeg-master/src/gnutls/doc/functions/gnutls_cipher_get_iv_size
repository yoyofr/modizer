@deftypefun {unsigned} {gnutls_cipher_get_iv_size} (gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t @var{algorithm})
@var{algorithm}: is an encryption algorithm

This function returns the size of the initialization vector (IV) for the
provided algorithm. For algorithms with variable size IV (e.g., AES-CCM),
the returned size will be the one used by TLS.

@strong{Returns:} block size for encryption algorithm.

@strong{Since:} 3.2.0
