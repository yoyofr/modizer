@deftypefun {size_t} {gnutls_record_discard_queued} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

This function discards all queued to be sent packets in a DTLS session.
These are the packets queued after an interrupted @code{gnutls_record_send()} .

This function can only be used with transports where @code{send()}  is
an all-or-nothing operation (e.g., UDP). When partial writes are allowed
this function will cause session errors.

@strong{Returns:} The number of bytes discarded.

@strong{Since:} 3.4.0
