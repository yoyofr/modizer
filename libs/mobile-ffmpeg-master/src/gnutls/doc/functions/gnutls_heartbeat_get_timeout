@deftypefun {unsigned int} {gnutls_heartbeat_get_timeout} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

This function will return the milliseconds remaining
for a retransmission of the previously sent ping
message. This function is useful when ping is used in
non-blocking mode, to estimate when to call @code{gnutls_heartbeat_ping()} 
if no packets have been received.

@strong{Returns:} the remaining time in milliseconds.

@strong{Since:} 3.1.2
