@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crq_get_signature_algorithm} (gnutls_x509_crq_t @var{crq})
@var{crq}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_cr_t}  type

This function will return a value of the @code{gnutls_sign_algorithm_t} 
enumeration that is the signature algorithm that has been used to
sign this certificate request.

Since 3.6.0 this function never returns a negative error code.
Error cases and unknown/unsupported signature algorithms are
mapped to @code{GNUTLS_SIGN_UNKNOWN} .

@strong{Returns:} a @code{gnutls_sign_algorithm_t}  value

@strong{Since:} 3.4.0
