@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, size_t @var{max})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{max}: is the maximum number.

This function will set the maximum size of all handshake messages.
Handshakes over this size are rejected with
@code{GNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE}  error code.  The default value is
128kb which is typically large enough.  Set this to 0 if you do not
want to set an upper limit.

The reason for restricting the handshake message sizes are to
limit Denial of Service attacks.

Note that the maximum handshake size was increased to 128kb
from 48kb in GnuTLS 3.5.5.
