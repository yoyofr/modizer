@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_pkcs7_get_crt_raw2} (gnutls_pkcs7_t @var{pkcs7}, unsigned @var{indx}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{cert})
@var{pkcs7}: should contain a gnutls_pkcs7_t type

@var{indx}: contains the index of the certificate to extract

@var{cert}: will hold the contents of the certificate; must be deallocated with @code{gnutls_free()} 

This function will return a certificate of the PKCS7 or RFC2630
certificate set.

After the last certificate has been read
@code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE}  will be returned.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.  If the provided buffer is not long enough,
then  @code{certificate_size} is updated and
@code{GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER}  is returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.4.2
