@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, void * @var{result}, size_t * @var{result_size})
@var{cert}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t}  type

@var{result}: The place where the serial number will be copied

@var{result_size}: Holds the size of the result field.

This function will return the X.509 certificate's serial number.
This is obtained by the X509 Certificate serialNumber field. Serial
is not always a 32 or 64bit number. Some CAs use large serial
numbers, thus it may be wise to handle it as something uint8_t.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
