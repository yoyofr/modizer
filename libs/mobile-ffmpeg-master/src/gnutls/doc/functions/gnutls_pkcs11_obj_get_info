@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_pkcs11_obj_get_info} (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t @var{obj}, gnutls_pkcs11_obj_info_t @var{itype}, void * @var{output}, size_t * @var{output_size})
@var{obj}: should contain a @code{gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t}  type

@var{itype}: Denotes the type of information requested

@var{output}: where output will be stored

@var{output_size}: contains the maximum size of the output buffer and will be
overwritten with the actual size.

This function will return information about the PKCS11 certificate
such as the label, id as well as token information where the key is
stored.

When output is text, a null terminated string is written to  @code{output} and its
string length is written to  @code{output_size} (without null terminator). If the
buffer is too small,  @code{output_size} will contain the expected buffer size
(with null terminator for text) and return @code{GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER} .

In versions previously to 3.6.0 this function included the null terminator
to  @code{output_size} . After 3.6.0 the output size doesn't include the terminator character.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) on success or a negative error code on error.

@strong{Since:} 2.12.0
