@deftypefun {unsigned} {gnutls_x509_crt_check_ip} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, const unsigned char * @var{ip}, unsigned int @var{ip_size}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{cert}: should contain an gnutls_x509_crt_t type

@var{ip}: A pointer to the raw IP address

@var{ip_size}: the number of bytes in ip (4 or 16)

@var{flags}: should be zero

This function will check if the IP allowed IP addresses in 
the certificate's subject alternative name match the provided
IP address.

@strong{Returns:} non-zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.
