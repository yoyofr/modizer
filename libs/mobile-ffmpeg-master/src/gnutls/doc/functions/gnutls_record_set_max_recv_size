@deftypefun {ssize_t} {gnutls_record_set_max_recv_size} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, size_t @var{size})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{size}: is the new size

This function sets the maximum amount of plaintext received in a
record in this connection.

The limit is also negotiated through a TLS extension called 'record
size limit'.  Note that while the 'record size limit' extension is
preferred, not all TLS implementations use or even understand the
extension.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.6.8
