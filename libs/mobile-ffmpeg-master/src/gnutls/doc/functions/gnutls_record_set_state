@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_record_set_state} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned @var{read}, const unsigned char [8] @var{seq_number})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type

@var{read}: if non-zero the read parameters are returned, otherwise the write

@var{seq_number}: A 64-bit sequence number

This function will set the sequence number in the current record state.
This function is useful if sending and receiving are offloaded from
gnutls. That is, if @code{gnutls_record_get_state()}  was used.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  on success, or an error code.

Since 3.4.0
