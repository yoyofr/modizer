@deftypefun {const char *} {gnutls_psk_client_get_hint} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a gnutls session

The PSK identity hint may give the client help in deciding which
username to use.  This should only be called in case of PSK
authentication and in case of a client.

@strong{Note:} there is no hint in TLS 1.3, so this function will return @code{NULL} 
if TLS 1.3 has been negotiated.

@strong{Returns:} the identity hint of the peer, or @code{NULL}  in case of an error or if TLS 1.3 is being used.

@strong{Since:} 2.4.0
