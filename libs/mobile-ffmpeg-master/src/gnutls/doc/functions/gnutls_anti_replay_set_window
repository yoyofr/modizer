@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_anti_replay_set_window} (gnutls_anti_replay_t @var{anti_replay}, unsigned int @var{window})
@var{anti_replay}: is a @code{gnutls_anti_replay_t}  type.

@var{window}: is the time window recording ClientHello, in milliseconds

Sets the time window used for ClientHello recording.  In order to
protect against replay attacks, the server records ClientHello
messages within this time period from the last update, and
considers it a replay when a ClientHello outside of the period; if
a ClientHello arrives within this period, the server checks the
database and detects duplicates.

For the details of the algorithm, see RFC 8446, section 8.2.
