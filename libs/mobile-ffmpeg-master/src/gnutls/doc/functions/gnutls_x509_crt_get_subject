@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, gnutls_x509_dn_t * @var{dn})
@var{cert}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t}  type

@var{dn}: output variable with pointer to uint8_t DN.

Return the Certificate's Subject DN as a @code{gnutls_x509_dn_t}  data type,
that can be decoded using @code{gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava()} .

Note that  @code{dn} should be treated as constant. Because it points
into the  @code{cert} object, you should not use  @code{dn} after  @code{cert} is
deallocated.

@strong{Returns:} Returns 0 on success, or an error code.
