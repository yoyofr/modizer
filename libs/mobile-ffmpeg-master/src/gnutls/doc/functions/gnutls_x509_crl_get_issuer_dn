@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn} (gnutls_x509_crl_t @var{crl}, char * @var{buf}, size_t * @var{sizeof_buf})
@var{crl}: should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

@var{buf}: a pointer to a structure to hold the peer's name (may be null)

@var{sizeof_buf}: initially holds the size of  @code{buf} 

This function will copy the name of the CRL issuer in the provided
buffer. The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as
described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
encoded, depending on the certificate data.

If buf is @code{NULL}  then only the size will be filled.

This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if
that is required see @code{gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn3()} .

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER}  if the provided buffer is
not long enough, and in that case the sizeof_buf will be updated
with the required size, and 0 on success.
