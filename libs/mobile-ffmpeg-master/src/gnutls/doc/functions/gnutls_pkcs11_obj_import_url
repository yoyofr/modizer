@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url} (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t @var{obj}, const char * @var{url}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{obj}: The structure to store the object

@var{url}: a PKCS 11 url identifying the key

@var{flags}: Or sequence of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags

This function will "import" a PKCS 11 URL identifying an object (e.g. certificate)
to the @code{gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t}  type. This does not involve any
parsing (such as X.509 or OpenPGP) since the @code{gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t}  is
format agnostic. Only data are transferred.

If the flag @code{GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT}  is specified
any certificate read, will have its extensions overwritten by any
stapled extensions in the trust module.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.

@strong{Since:} 2.12.0
