@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_ext_import_inhibit_anypolicy} (const gnutls_datum_t * @var{ext}, unsigned int * @var{skipcerts})
@var{ext}: the DER encoded extension data

@var{skipcerts}: will hold the number of certificates after which anypolicy is no longer acceptable.

This function will return certificate's value of SkipCerts,
by reading the DER data of the Inhibit anyPolicy X.509 extension (2.5.29.54).

The  @code{skipcerts} value is the number of additional certificates that
may appear in the path before the anyPolicy (@code{GNUTLS_X509_OID_POLICY_ANY} )
is no longer acceptable.

@strong{Returns:} zero, or a negative error code in case of
parsing error.  If the certificate does not contain the Inhibit anyPolicy
extension @code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE}  will be
returned.

@strong{Since:} 3.6.0
