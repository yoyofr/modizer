@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_heartbeat_set_timeouts} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned int @var{retrans_timeout}, unsigned int @var{total_timeout})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{retrans_timeout}: The time at which a retransmission will occur in milliseconds

@var{total_timeout}: The time at which the connection will be aborted, in milliseconds.

This function will override the timeouts for the DTLS heartbeat
protocol. The retransmission timeout is the time after which a
message from the peer is not received, the previous request will
be retransmitted. The total timeout is the time after which the
handshake will be aborted with @code{GNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT} .
