@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_memcmp} (const void * @var{s1}, const void * @var{s2}, size_t @var{n})
@var{s1}: the first address to compare

@var{s2}: the second address to compare

@var{n}: the size of memory to compare

This function will operate similarly to @code{memcmp()} , but will operate
on time that depends only on the size of the string. That is will
not return early if the strings don't match on the first byte.

@strong{Returns:} non zero on difference and zero if the buffers are identical.

@strong{Since:} 3.4.0
