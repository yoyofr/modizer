@deftypefun {unsigned} {gnutls_sign_supports_pk_algorithm} (gnutls_sign_algorithm_t @var{sign}, gnutls_pk_algorithm_t @var{pk})
@var{sign}: is a signature algorithm

@var{pk}: is a public key algorithm

This function returns non-zero if the public key algorithm corresponds to
the given signature algorithm. That is, if that signature can be generated
from the given private key algorithm.

@strong{Since:} 3.6.0

@strong{Returns:} return non-zero when the provided algorithms are compatible.
