@deftypefun {unsigned} {gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, const char * @var{hostname})
@var{cert}: should contain an gnutls_x509_crt_t type

@var{hostname}: A null terminated string that contains a DNS name

This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches
the given hostname.  This is a basic implementation of the matching
described in RFC6125, and takes into account wildcards,
and the DNSName/IPAddress subject alternative name PKIX extension.

For details see also @code{gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2()} .

@strong{Returns:} non-zero for a successful match, and zero on failure.
