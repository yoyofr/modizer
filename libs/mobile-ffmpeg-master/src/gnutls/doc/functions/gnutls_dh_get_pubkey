@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_dh_get_pubkey} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{raw_key})
@var{session}: is a gnutls session

@var{raw_key}: will hold the public key.

This function will return the peer's public key used in the last
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  This function should be used for both
anonymous and ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.  The output parameters must
be freed with @code{gnutls_free()} .

Note, that public key is exported as non-negative
integer and may include a leading zero byte.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
