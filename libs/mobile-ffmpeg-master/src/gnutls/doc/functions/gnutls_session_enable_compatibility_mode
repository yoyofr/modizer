@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

This function can be used to disable certain (security) features in
TLS in order to maintain maximum compatibility with buggy
clients. Because several trade-offs with security are enabled,
if required they will be reported through the audit subsystem.

Normally only servers that require maximum compatibility with
everything out there, need to call this function.

Note that this function must be called after any call to gnutls_priority
functions.
