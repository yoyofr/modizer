@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_record_disable_padding} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

Used to disabled padding in TLS 1.0 and above.  Normally you do not
need to use this function, but there are buggy clients that
complain if a server pads the encrypted data.  This of course will
disable protection against statistical attacks on the data.

This function is defunct since 3.1.7. Random padding is disabled
by default unless requested using @code{gnutls_record_send_range()} .
