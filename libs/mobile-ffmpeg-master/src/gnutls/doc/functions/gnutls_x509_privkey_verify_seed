@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_privkey_verify_seed} (gnutls_x509_privkey_t @var{key}, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t @var{digest}, const void * @var{seed}, size_t @var{seed_size})
@var{key}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_privkey_t}  type

@var{digest}: it contains the digest algorithm used for key generation (if applicable)

@var{seed}: the seed of the key to be checked with

@var{seed_size}: holds the size of  @code{seed} 

This function will verify that the given private key was generated from
the provided seed. If  @code{seed} is @code{NULL}  then the seed stored in the  @code{key} 's structure
will be used for verification.

@strong{Returns:} In case of a verification failure @code{GNUTLS_E_PRIVKEY_VERIFICATION_ERROR} 
is returned, and zero or positive code on success.

@strong{Since:} 3.5.0
