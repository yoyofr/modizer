@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_dtls_set_timeouts} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned int @var{retrans_timeout}, unsigned int @var{total_timeout})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{retrans_timeout}: The time at which a retransmission will occur in milliseconds

@var{total_timeout}: The time at which the connection will be aborted, in milliseconds.

This function will set the timeouts required for the DTLS handshake
protocol. The retransmission timeout is the time after which a
message from the peer is not received, the previous messages will
be retransmitted. The total timeout is the time after which the
handshake will be aborted with @code{GNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT} .

The DTLS protocol recommends the values of 1 sec and 60 seconds
respectively, and these are the default values.

To disable retransmissions set a  @code{retrans_timeout} larger than the  @code{total_timeout} .
