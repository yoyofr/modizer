@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{res}, gnutls_x509_crt_t * @var{ca_list}, int @var{ca_list_size})
@var{res}: is a @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t}  type.

@var{ca_list_size}: holds the size of the CA list

This function adds the trusted CAs in order to verify client
or server certificates. In case of a client this is not required
to be called if the certificates are not verified using
@code{gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()} .
This function may be called multiple times.

In case of a server the CAs set here will be sent to the client if
a certificate request is sent. This can be disabled using
@code{gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence()} .

@strong{Returns:} the number of certificates processed or a negative error code
on error.

@strong{Since:} 2.4.0
