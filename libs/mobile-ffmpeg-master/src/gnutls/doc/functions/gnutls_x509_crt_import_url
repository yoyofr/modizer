@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_import_url} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{crt}, const char * @var{url}, unsigned int @var{flags})
@var{crt}: A certificate of type @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t} 

@var{url}: A PKCS 11 url

This function will import a certificate present in a PKCS@code{11}  token
or any type of back-end that supports URLs.

In previous versions of gnutls this function was named
gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11_url, and the old name is
an alias to this one.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
