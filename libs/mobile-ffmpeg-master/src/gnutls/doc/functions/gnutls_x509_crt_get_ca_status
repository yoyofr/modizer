@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_get_ca_status} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, unsigned int * @var{critical})
@var{cert}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t}  type

@var{critical}: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

This function will return certificates CA status, by reading the
basicConstraints X.509 extension (2.5.29.19). If the certificate is
a CA a positive value will be returned, or (0) if the certificate
does not have CA flag set.

Use @code{gnutls_x509_crt_get_basic_constraints()}  if you want to read the
pathLenConstraint field too.

@strong{Returns:} If the certificate is a CA a positive value will be
returned, or (0) if the certificate does not have CA flag set.  A
negative error code may be returned in case of errors.  If the
certificate does not contain the basicConstraints extension
GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
