@deftypefun {int} {dane_query_to_raw_tlsa} (dane_query_t @var{q}, unsigned int * @var{data_entries}, char *** @var{dane_data}, int ** @var{dane_data_len}, int * @var{secure}, int * @var{bogus})
@var{q}: The query result structure

@var{data_entries}: Pointer set to the number of entries in the query

@var{dane_data}: Pointer to contain an array of DNS rdata items, terminated with a NULL pointer;
caller must guarantee that the referenced data remains
valid until @code{dane_query_deinit()}  is called.

@var{dane_data_len}: Pointer to contain the length n bytes of the dane_data items

@var{secure}: Pointer set true if the result is validated securely, false if
validation failed or the domain queried has no security info

@var{bogus}: Pointer set true if the result was not secure due to a security failure

This function will provide the DANE data from the query
response.

The pointers dane_data and dane_data_len are allocated with @code{gnutls_malloc()} 
to contain the data from the query result structure (individual
 @code{dane_data} items simply point to the original data and are not allocated separately).
The returned  @code{dane_data} are only valid during the lifetime of  @code{q} .

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{DANE_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
