@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned int @var{bits})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{bits}: is the number of bits

This function sets the number of bits, for use in a Diffie-Hellman
key exchange.  This is used both in DH ephemeral and DH anonymous
cipher suites.  This will set the minimum size of the prime that
will be used for the handshake.

In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.  If
a server sends a prime with less bits than that
@code{GNUTLS_E_DH_PRIME_UNACCEPTABLE}  will be returned by the handshake.

Note that this function will warn via the audit log for value that
are believed to be weak.

The function has no effect in server side.

Note that since 3.1.7 this function is deprecated. The minimum
number of bits is set by the priority string level.
Also this function must be called after @code{gnutls_priority_set_direct()} 
or the set value may be overridden by the selected priority options.
