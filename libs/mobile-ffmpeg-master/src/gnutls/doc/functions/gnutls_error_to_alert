@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_error_to_alert} (int @var{err}, int * @var{level})
@var{err}: is a negative integer

@var{level}: the alert level will be stored there

Get an alert depending on the error code returned by a gnutls
function.  All alerts sent by this function should be considered
fatal.  The only exception is when  @code{err} is @code{GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE} ,
where a warning alert should be sent to the peer indicating that no
renegotiation will be performed.

If there is no mapping to a valid alert the alert to indicate
internal error (@code{GNUTLS_A_INTERNAL_ERROR} ) is returned.

@strong{Returns:} the alert code to use for a particular error code.
