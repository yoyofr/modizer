@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crq_set_dn_by_oid} (gnutls_x509_crq_t @var{crq}, const char * @var{oid}, unsigned int @var{raw_flag}, const void * @var{data}, unsigned int @var{sizeof_data})
@var{crq}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crq_t}  type

@var{oid}: holds an Object Identifier in a (0)-terminated string

@var{raw_flag}: must be 0, or 1 if the data are DER encoded

@var{data}: a pointer to the input data

@var{sizeof_data}: holds the size of  @code{data} 

This function will set the part of the name of the Certificate
request subject, specified by the given OID.  The input string
should be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded.

Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
With this function you can only set the known OIDs.  You can test
for known OIDs using @code{gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()} .  For OIDs that are
not known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data, and
call this function with raw_flag set.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
