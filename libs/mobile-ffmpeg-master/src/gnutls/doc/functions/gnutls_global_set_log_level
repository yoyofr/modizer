@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_global_set_log_level} (int @var{level})
@var{level}: it's an integer from 0 to 99.

This is the function that allows you to set the log level.  The
level is an integer between 0 and 9.  Higher values mean more
verbosity. The default value is 0.  Larger values should only be
used with care, since they may reveal sensitive information.

Use a log level over 10 to enable all debugging options.
