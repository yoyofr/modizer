@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_x509_trust_list_deinit} (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t @var{list}, unsigned int @var{all})
@var{list}: The list to be deinitialized

@var{all}: if non-zero it will deinitialize all the certificates and CRLs contained in the structure.

This function will deinitialize a trust list. Note that the
 @code{all} flag should be typically non-zero unless you have specified
your certificates using @code{gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas()}  and you
want to prevent them from being deinitialized by this function.

@strong{Since:} 3.0.0
