@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crl_verify} (gnutls_x509_crl_t @var{crl}, const gnutls_x509_crt_t * @var{trusted_cas}, unsigned @var{tcas_size}, unsigned int @var{flags}, unsigned int * @var{verify})
@var{crl}: is the crl to be verified

@var{trusted_cas}: is a certificate list that is considered to be trusted one

@var{tcas_size}: holds the number of CA certificates in CA_list

@var{flags}: Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

@var{verify}: will hold the crl verification output.

This function will try to verify the given crl and return its verification status.
See @code{gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify()}  for a detailed description of
return values. Note that since GnuTLS 3.1.4 this function includes
the time checks.

Note that value in  @code{verify} is set only when the return value of this 
function is success (i.e, failure to trust a CRL a certificate does not imply 
a negative return value).

Before GnuTLS 3.5.7 this function would return zero or a positive
number on success.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0), otherwise a
negative error value.
