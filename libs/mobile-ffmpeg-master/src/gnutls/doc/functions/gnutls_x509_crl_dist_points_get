@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crl_dist_points_get} (gnutls_x509_crl_dist_points_t @var{cdp}, unsigned int @var{seq}, unsigned int * @var{type}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{san}, unsigned int * @var{reasons})
@var{cdp}: The CRL distribution points

@var{seq}: specifies the sequence number of the distribution point (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)

@var{type}: The name type of the corresponding name (gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t)

@var{san}: The distribution point names (to be treated as constant)

@var{reasons}: Revocation reasons. An ORed sequence of flags from @code{gnutls_x509_crl_reason_flags_t} .

This function retrieves the individual CRL distribution points (2.5.29.31),
contained in provided type. 

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, @code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE} 
if the index is out of bounds, otherwise a negative error value.
