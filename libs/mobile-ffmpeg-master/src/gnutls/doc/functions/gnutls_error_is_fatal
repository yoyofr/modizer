@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_error_is_fatal} (int @var{error})
@var{error}: is a GnuTLS error code, a negative error code

If a GnuTLS function returns a negative error code you may feed that
value to this function to see if the error condition is fatal to
a TLS session (i.e., must be terminated).

Note that you may also want to check the error code manually, since some
non-fatal errors to the protocol (such as a warning alert or
a rehandshake request) may be fatal for your program.

This function is only useful if you are dealing with errors from
functions that relate to a TLS session (e.g., record layer or handshake
layer handling functions).

@strong{Returns:} Non-zero value on fatal errors or zero on non-fatal.
