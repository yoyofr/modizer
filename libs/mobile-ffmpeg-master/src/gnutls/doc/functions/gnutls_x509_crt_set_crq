@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_set_crq} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{crt}, gnutls_x509_crq_t @var{crq})
@var{crt}: a certificate of type @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t} 

@var{crq}: holds a certificate request

This function will set the name and public parameters as well as
the extensions from the given certificate request to the certificate. 
Only RSA keys are currently supported.

Note that this function will only set the  @code{crq} if it is self
signed and the signature is correct. See @code{gnutls_x509_crq_sign2()} .

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
