@deftypefun {unsigned} {gnutls_ext_get_current_msg} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: a @code{gnutls_session_t}  opaque pointer

This function allows an extension handler to obtain the message
this extension is being called from. The returned value is a single
entry of the @code{gnutls_ext_flags_t}  enumeration. That is, if an
extension was registered with the @code{GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_HRR}  and
@code{GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_EE}  flags, the value when called during parsing of the
encrypted extensions message will be @code{GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_EE} .

If not called under an extension handler, its value is undefined.
