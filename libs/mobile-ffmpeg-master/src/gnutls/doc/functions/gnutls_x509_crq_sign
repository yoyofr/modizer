@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crq_sign} (gnutls_x509_crq_t @var{crq}, gnutls_x509_privkey_t @var{key})
@var{crq}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crq_t}  type

@var{key}: holds a private key

This function is the same a @code{gnutls_x509_crq_sign2()}  with no flags,
and an appropriate hash algorithm. The hash algorithm used may
vary between versions of GnuTLS, and it is tied to the security
level of the issuer's public key.

A known limitation of this function is, that a newly-signed request will not
be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification), until it
is exported an re-imported.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
