@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_transport_set_int2} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, int @var{recv_fd}, int @var{send_fd})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{recv_fd}: is socket descriptor for the pull function

@var{send_fd}: is socket descriptor for the push function

This function sets the first argument of the transport functions,
such as @code{send()}  and @code{recv()}  for the default callbacks using the
system's socket API. With this function you can set two different
descriptors for receiving and sending.

This function is equivalent to calling @code{gnutls_transport_set_ptr2()} 
with the descriptors, but requires no casts.
