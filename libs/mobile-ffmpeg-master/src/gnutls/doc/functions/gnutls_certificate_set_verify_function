@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{cred}, gnutls_certificate_verify_function * @var{func})
@var{cred}: is a @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t}  type.

@var{func}: is the callback function

This function sets a callback to be called when peer's certificate
has been received in order to verify it on receipt rather than
doing after the handshake is completed.

The callback's function prototype is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t);

If the callback function is provided then gnutls will call it, in the
handshake, just after the certificate message has been received.
To verify or obtain the certificate the @code{gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()} ,
@code{gnutls_certificate_type_get()} , @code{gnutls_certificate_get_peers()}  functions
can be used.

The callback function should return 0 for the handshake to continue
or non-zero to terminate.
