@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_global_set_log_function} (gnutls_log_func @var{log_func})
@var{log_func}: it's a log function

This is the function where you set the logging function gnutls is
going to use.  This function only accepts a character array.
Normally you may not use this function since it is only used for
debugging purposes.

 @code{gnutls_log_func} is of the form,
void (*gnutls_log_func)( int level, const char*);
@end deftypefun
