@deftypefun {time_t} {gnutls_certificate_get_ocsp_expiration} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{sc}, unsigned @var{idx}, int @var{oidx}, unsigned @var{flags})
@var{sc}: is a credentials structure.

@var{idx}: is a certificate chain index as returned by @code{gnutls_certificate_set_key()}  and friends

@var{oidx}: is an OCSP response index

@var{flags}: should be zero

This function returns the validity of the loaded OCSP responses,
to provide information on when to reload/refresh them.

Note that the credentials structure should be read-only when in
use, thus when reloading, either the credentials structure must not
be in use by any sessions, or a new credentials structure should be
allocated for new sessions.

When  @code{oidx} is (-1) then the minimum refresh time for all responses
is returned. Otherwise the index specifies the response corresponding
to the  @code{odix} certificate in the certificate chain.

@strong{Returns:} On success, the expiration time of the OCSP response. Otherwise
(time_t)(-1) on error, or (time_t)-2 on out of bounds.

@strong{Since:} 3.6.3
