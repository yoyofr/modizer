This function will send an alert to the peer in order to inform
him of something important (eg. his Certificate could not be verified).
If the alert level is Fatal then the peer is expected to close the
connection, otherwise he may ignore the alert and continue.

The error code of the underlying record send function will be
returned, so you may also receive @code{GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED}  or
@code{GNUTLS_E_AGAIN}  as well.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
