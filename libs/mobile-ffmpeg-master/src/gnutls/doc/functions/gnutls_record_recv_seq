@deftypefun {ssize_t} {gnutls_record_recv_seq} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, void * @var{data}, size_t @var{data_size}, unsigned char * @var{seq})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{data}: the buffer that the data will be read into

@var{data_size}: the number of requested bytes

@var{seq}: is the packet's 64-bit sequence number. Should have space for 8 bytes.

This function is the same as @code{gnutls_record_recv()} , except that
it returns in addition to data, the sequence number of the data.
This is useful in DTLS where record packets might be received
out-of-order. The returned 8-byte sequence number is an
integer in big-endian format and should be
treated as a unique message identification.

@strong{Returns:} The number of bytes received and zero on EOF.  A negative
error code is returned in case of an error.  The number of bytes
received might be less than  @code{data_size} .

@strong{Since:} 3.0
