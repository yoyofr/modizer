@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_global_deinit} ( @var{void})

This function deinitializes the global data, that were initialized
using @code{gnutls_global_init()} .

Since GnuTLS 3.3.0 this function is no longer necessary to be explicitly
called. GnuTLS will automatically deinitialize on library destructor. See
@code{gnutls_global_init()}  for disabling the implicit initialization/deinitialization.
