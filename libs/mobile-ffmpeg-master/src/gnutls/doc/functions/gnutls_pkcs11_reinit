@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_pkcs11_reinit} ( @var{void})

This function will reinitialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls. 
This is required by PKCS 11 when an application uses @code{fork()} . The
reinitialization function must be called on the child.

Note that since GnuTLS 3.3.0, the reinitialization of the PKCS @code{11} 
subsystem occurs automatically after fork.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.

@strong{Since:} 3.0
