@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_verify} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, const gnutls_x509_crt_t * @var{CA_list}, unsigned @var{CA_list_length}, unsigned int @var{flags}, unsigned int * @var{verify})
@var{cert}: is the certificate to be verified

@var{CA_list}: is one certificate that is considered to be trusted one

@var{CA_list_length}: holds the number of CA certificate in CA_list

@var{flags}: Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm. Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

@var{verify}: will hold the certificate verification output.

This function will try to verify the given certificate and return
its status. Note that a verification error does not imply a negative
return status. In that case the  @code{verify} status is set.

The details of the verification are the same
as in @code{gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2()} .

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
