@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_fingerprint} (gnutls_digest_algorithm_t @var{algo}, const gnutls_datum_t * @var{data}, void * @var{result}, size_t * @var{result_size})
@var{algo}: is a digest algorithm

@var{data}: is the data

@var{result}: is the place where the result will be copied (may be null).

@var{result_size}: should hold the size of the result. The actual size
of the returned result will also be copied there.

This function will calculate a fingerprint (actually a hash), of
the given data.  The result is not printable data.  You should
convert it to hex, or to something else printable.

This is the usual way to calculate a fingerprint of an X.509 DER
encoded certificate.  Note however that the fingerprint of an
OpenPGP certificate is not just a hash and cannot be calculated with this
function.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
