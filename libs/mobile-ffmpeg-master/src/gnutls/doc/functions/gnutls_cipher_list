@deftypefun {const gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t *} {gnutls_cipher_list} ( @var{void})

Get a list of supported cipher algorithms.  Note that not
necessarily all ciphers are supported as TLS cipher suites.  For
example, DES is not supported as a cipher suite, but is supported
for other purposes (e.g., PKCS@code{8}  or similar).

This function is not thread safe.

@strong{Returns:} a (0)-terminated list of @code{gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t} 
integers indicating the available ciphers.
