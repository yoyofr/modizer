@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_alert_send_appropriate} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, int @var{err})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{err}: is an error code returned by another GnuTLS function

Sends an alert to the peer depending on the error code returned by
a gnutls function. This function will call @code{gnutls_error_to_alert()} 
to determine the appropriate alert to send.

This function may also return @code{GNUTLS_E_AGAIN} , or
@code{GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED} .

This function historically was always sending an alert to the
peer, even if  @code{err} was inappropriate to respond with an alert
(e.g., @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS} ). Since 3.6.6 this function returns
success without transmitting any data on error codes that
should not result to an alert.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
