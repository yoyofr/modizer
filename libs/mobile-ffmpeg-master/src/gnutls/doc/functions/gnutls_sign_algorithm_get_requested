@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, size_t @var{indx}, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * @var{algo})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{indx}: is an index of the signature algorithm to return

@var{algo}: the returned certificate type will be stored there

Returns the signature algorithm specified by index that was
requested by the peer. If the specified index has no data available
this function returns @code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE} .  If
the negotiated TLS version does not support signature algorithms
then @code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE}  will be returned even
for the first index.  The first index is 0.

This function is useful in the certificate callback functions
to assist in selecting the correct certificate.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.

@strong{Since:} 2.10.0
