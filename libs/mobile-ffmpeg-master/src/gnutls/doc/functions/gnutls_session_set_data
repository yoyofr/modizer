@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_session_set_data} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, const void * @var{session_data}, size_t @var{session_data_size})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{session_data}: is a pointer to space to hold the session.

@var{session_data_size}: is the session's size

Sets all session parameters, in order to resume a previously
established session.  The session data given must be the one
returned by @code{gnutls_session_get_data()} .  This function should be
called before @code{gnutls_handshake()} .

Keep in mind that session resuming is advisory. The server may
choose not to resume the session, thus a full handshake will be
performed.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
