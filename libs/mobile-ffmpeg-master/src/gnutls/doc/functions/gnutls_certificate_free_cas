@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_certificate_free_cas} (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t @var{sc})
@var{sc}: is a @code{gnutls_certificate_credentials_t}  type.

This function was operational on very early versions of gnutls.
Due to internal refactorings and the fact that this was hardly ever
used, it is currently a no-op.
