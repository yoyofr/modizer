@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crl_get_dn_oid} (gnutls_x509_crl_t @var{crl}, unsigned @var{indx}, void * @var{oid}, size_t * @var{sizeof_oid})
@var{crl}: should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t type

@var{indx}: Specifies which DN OID to send. Use (0) to get the first one.

@var{oid}: a pointer to store the OID (may be null)

@var{sizeof_oid}: initially holds the size of 'oid'

This function will extract the requested OID of the name of the CRL
issuer, specified by the given index.

If oid is null then only the size will be filled.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER}  if the provided buffer is
not long enough, and in that case the sizeof_oid will be updated
with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
