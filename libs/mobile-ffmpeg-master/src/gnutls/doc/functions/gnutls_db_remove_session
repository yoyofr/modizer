@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_db_remove_session} (gnutls_session_t @var{session})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

This function will remove the current session data from the
session database.  This will prevent future handshakes reusing
these session data.  This function should be called if a session
was terminated abnormally, and before @code{gnutls_deinit()}  is called.

Normally @code{gnutls_deinit()}  will remove abnormally terminated
sessions.
