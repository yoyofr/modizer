@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_system_recv_timeout} (gnutls_transport_ptr_t @var{ptr}, unsigned int @var{ms})
@var{ptr}: A file descriptor (wrapped in a gnutls_transport_ptr_t pointer)

@var{ms}: The number of milliseconds to wait.

Wait for data to be received from the provided socket ( @code{ptr} ) within a
timeout period in milliseconds, using @code{select()}  on the provided  @code{ptr} .

This function is provided as a helper for constructing custom
callbacks for @code{gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function()} ,
which can be used if you rely on socket file descriptors.

Returns -1 on error, 0 on timeout, positive value if data are available for reading.

@strong{Since:} 3.4.0
