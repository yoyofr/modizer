@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_alpn_get_selected_protocol} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{protocol})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{protocol}: will hold the protocol name

This function allows you to get the negotiated protocol name. The
returned protocol should be treated as opaque, constant value and
only valid during the session life.

The selected protocol is the first supported by the list sent
by the client.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.

Since 3.2.0
