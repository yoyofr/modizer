@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{crt}, const char * @var{oid}, unsigned int @var{raw_flag}, const void * @var{name}, unsigned int @var{sizeof_name})
@var{crt}: a certificate of type @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t} 

@var{oid}: holds an Object Identifier in a null terminated string

@var{raw_flag}: must be 0, or 1 if the data are DER encoded

@var{name}: a pointer to the name

@var{sizeof_name}: holds the size of  @code{name} 

This function will set the part of the name of the Certificate
subject, specified by the given OID. The input string should be
ASCII or UTF-8 encoded.

Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
With this function you can only set the known OIDs. You can test
for known OIDs using @code{gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()} . For OIDs that are
not known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data,
and call this function with  @code{raw_flag} set.

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
