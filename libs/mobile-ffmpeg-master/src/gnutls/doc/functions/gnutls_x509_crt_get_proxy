@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crt_get_proxy} (gnutls_x509_crt_t @var{cert}, unsigned int * @var{critical}, int * @var{pathlen}, char ** @var{policyLanguage}, char ** @var{policy}, size_t * @var{sizeof_policy})
@var{cert}: should contain a @code{gnutls_x509_crt_t}  type

@var{critical}: will be non-zero if the extension is marked as critical

@var{pathlen}: pointer to output integer indicating path length (may be
NULL), non-negative error codes indicate a present pCPathLenConstraint
field and the actual value, -1 indicate that the field is absent.

@var{policyLanguage}: output variable with OID of policy language

@var{policy}: output variable with policy data

@var{sizeof_policy}: output variable size of policy data

This function will get information from a proxy certificate.  It
reads the ProxyCertInfo X.509 extension (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1.14).

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned,
otherwise a negative error code is returned.
