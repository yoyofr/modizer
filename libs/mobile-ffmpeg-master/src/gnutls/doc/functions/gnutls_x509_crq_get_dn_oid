@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn_oid} (gnutls_x509_crq_t @var{crq}, unsigned @var{indx}, void * @var{oid}, size_t * @var{sizeof_oid})
@var{crq}: should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t type

@var{indx}: Specifies which DN OID to get. Use (0) to get the first one.

@var{oid}: a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be @code{NULL} )

@var{sizeof_oid}: initially holds the size of  @code{oid} 

This function will extract the requested OID of the name of the
certificate request subject, specified by the given index.

@strong{Returns:} @code{GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER}  if the provided buffer is
not long enough, and in that case the * @code{sizeof_oid} will be
updated with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
