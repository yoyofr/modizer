@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_x509_name_constraints_get_excluded} (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t @var{nc}, unsigned @var{idx}, unsigned * @var{type}, gnutls_datum_t * @var{name})
@var{nc}: the extracted name constraints

@var{idx}: the index of the constraint

@var{type}: the type of the constraint (of type gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t)

@var{name}: the name in the constraint (of the specific type)

This function will return an intermediate type containing
the name constraints of the provided CA certificate. That
structure can be used in combination with @code{gnutls_x509_name_constraints_check()} 
to verify whether a server's name is in accordance with the constraints.

The name should be treated as constant and valid for the lifetime of  @code{nc} .

@strong{Returns:} On success, @code{GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS}  (0) is returned, @code{GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE} 
if the extension is not present, otherwise a negative error value.

@strong{Since:} 3.3.0
