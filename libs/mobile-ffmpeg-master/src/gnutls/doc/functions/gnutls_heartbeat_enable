@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_heartbeat_enable} (gnutls_session_t @var{session}, unsigned int @var{type})
@var{session}: is a @code{gnutls_session_t}  type.

@var{type}: one of the GNUTLS_HB_* flags

If this function is called with the @code{GNUTLS_HB_PEER_ALLOWED_TO_SEND} 
 @code{type} , GnuTLS will allow heartbeat messages to be received. Moreover it also
request the peer to accept heartbeat messages. This function
must be called prior to TLS handshake.

If the  @code{type} used is @code{GNUTLS_HB_LOCAL_ALLOWED_TO_SEND} , then the peer
will be asked to accept heartbeat messages but not send ones.

The function @code{gnutls_heartbeat_allowed()}  can be used to test Whether
locally generated heartbeat messages can be accepted by the peer.
