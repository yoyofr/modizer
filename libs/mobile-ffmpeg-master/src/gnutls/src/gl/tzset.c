   tzset function from Solaris 2.5, 2.5.1, and 2.6 has this problem.  */

  /* Rectify the value of the environment variable TZ.
     There are four possible kinds of such values:
       - Traditional US time zone names, e.g. "PST8PDT".  Syntax: see
         <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/tzset>
       - Time zone names based on geography, that contain one or more
         slashes, e.g. "Europe/Moscow".
       - Time zone names based on geography, without slashes, e.g.
         "Singapore".
       - Time zone names that contain explicit DST rules.  Syntax: see
         <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08_03>
     The Microsoft CRT understands only the first kind.  It produces incorrect
     results if the value of TZ is of the other kinds.
     But in a Cygwin environment, /etc/profile.d/tzset.sh sets TZ to a value
     of the second kind for most geographies, or of the first kind in a few
     other geographies.  If it is of the second kind, neutralize it.  For the
     Microsoft CRT, an absent or empty TZ means the time zone that the user
     has set in the Windows Control Panel.
     If the value of TZ is of the third or fourth kind -- Cygwin programs
     understand these syntaxes as well --, it does not matter whether we
     neutralize it or not, since these values occur only when a Cygwin user
     has set TZ explicitly; this case is 1. rare and 2. under the user's
     responsibility.  */
