/* A hash table of fixed size.  Multiple threads can access it read-only
   simultaneously, but only one thread can insert into it or remove from it
   at the same time.
   This hash table has global scope, so that when an application uses both
   GNU libintl and gnulib, the application sees only one hash table.  (When
   linking statically with libintl, the fact that localename-table.c is a
   separate compilation unit resolves the duplicate symbol conflict.  When
   linking with libintl as a shared library, we rely on ELF and the symbol
   conflict resolution implemented in the ELF dynamic loader here.)
   Both the libintl overrides and the gnulib overrides of the functions
   newlocale, duplocale, freelocale see the same hash table (and the same lock).
   For this reason, the internal layout of the hash table and the hash function
   MUST NEVER CHANGE.  If you need to change the internal layout or the hash
   function, introduce versioning by appending a version suffix to the symbols
   at the linker level.  */
