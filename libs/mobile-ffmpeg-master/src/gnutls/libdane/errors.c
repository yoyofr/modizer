/**
 * dane_strerror:
 * @error: is a DANE error code, a negative error code
 *
 * This function is similar to strerror.  The difference is that it
 * accepts an error number returned by a gnutls function; In case of
 * an unknown error a descriptive string is sent instead of %NULL.
 *
 * Error codes are always a negative error code.
 *
 * Returns: A string explaining the DANE error message.
