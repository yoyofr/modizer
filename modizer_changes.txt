Tips
- identify all global symbols (to buid rename header file)=> nm -g liblibatariaudio.a
one liner example:

  nm -g liblibatariaudio.a|grep "_m68k"|cut -c 21-|awk -F: '{ print "-D " $1 "=as_" $1 }'

- generate font from ttf file: FontGen.exe, needs wine

Todo/Requested:
���������

- Todo: keep download queue when exit program and restore at next launch
- Todo: add PDX/MDX to keyboard visualizer
- Bug/playlist:
When editing playlists with many files (several thousand), Modizer will clear the full playlist so I have to re-add everything from scratch. So trying to organize alphabetically or even deleting a single file will cause Modizer to crash and the playlist is empty when re-opening the app.

One suggestion would be to copy/paste playlists or add all songs from one playlist into another. Personally, it would save me a lot of time if I was able to copy everything from one playlist into another, rather than having to add tracks folder by folder.


- [UI] settings => when value available (not combo list or on/off switch), display it below label
- [DOWNLOAD] improve download resilience (keep track of queue in case of crash, auto restart, ...)
- TODO: replace vgmplay by libvgm
- TODO: add description for Settings when relevant
- TODO: add S98 playback library
- TODO: add WSR playback library

- TODO: .tar.gz support, i.e. tar support (gz ok / fex)
- TODO: rework online tab orga, multi level (DBs/Games/Mods & related/Others, then second level, ...)
- TODO: add an option to show all files in file browser (for ex swipe right the top line)
- TODO: when liking an archive/subsong entry, ask if for entry or file with a popup

- libs not generating oscilloscope output:
  - ASAP: waiting feedback from Piotr
  - GME(except snes): have to review blip_buffer logic, probably implement more blip_buffer (1/voice)
  - vgmstream: not sure it'ss worth doing it as it is mostly streaming from stereo sourcecode
  - LibKSS
  - SC68

missing seek support:
  - UADE

=> midi viewer: adapt color or bar size / volume of the played note? 
=> add launch popup with last changes (ex: regexp for Searches)
=> check why waiting pop-up not always visible (for ex when seeking or loading a large compressed file) 
=> add a small progress bar in cells in modland/asma/hvsc... When downloading
=> update playback libs to latest version
=> ADPLUG oscillo data not generated with OPL is not Woody
=> HC /PSF2 fadeout for oscillo
