This is msinttypes from https://github.com/chemeris/msinttypes/ .
The header files have been moved to sperate directories so the availability to a certain compiler version can be selected by setting the include path.
VS2008 needs both, VS1010 already has stdint.h so having msinttypes completely in the include path would just totally confuse the compiler.
No further local changes were made.
