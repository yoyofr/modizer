Of course there is still something that can be improved in OpenMPT, but there
are some things which definitely should be done at some point. Those include:

* Getting rid of the buggy MFC code. Instead use something like Qt.
* While we're at it, make OpenMPT cross-platform. :)
* Developement of a proper MPTM format. Currently, it's just based on the
  Impulse Tracker format and new features are hacked on at the end of the file.
  Not very nice!
* Better VST support. Currently, many great VST 2.4 features like buses are not
  supported.


Some things that could also be implemented:

* Resizable channels with multiple effect columns. This might not be trivial at
  all, especially when dealing with effects which could interfer with each other
  (f.e. porta up in one column, porta down in another).
