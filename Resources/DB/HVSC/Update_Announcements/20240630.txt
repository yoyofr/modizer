# Ultimate-64 firmware v3.11 & v3.11a #
#######################################

The Ultimate 64 is a main board for your beloved C64 case. This board is a
hardware implementation (FPGA) of the entire C64, and it includes the
Ultimate-II+ cartridge as well. An all-in-one solution.

SID related changes in the update:

- Fixed issue with possible tune data overwritten by the player code
- Fixed issue with bank not set correctly for some RSID tunes
- Fixed inverse mode to be reset at every line now for MUS tunes
- Fixed issue for tunes that have not enough space for screen output
- ReST API support which allows e.g. ACID64 Player to play SIDs via the network
  (WiFi or wired) on the Ultimate device.

# SIDBlaster-USB Nano #
#######################

Jaakko Oranen released a new version of the SIDBlaster-USB Nano board.

Changes in V1.3:

- Soft start circuit removed as some users reported it was causing connection
  issues with their USB-hubs. It's not actually needed. USB specification
  requires soft start circuit if initial current draw of hotplugged device is
  over 500mA. SIDBlaster-USB Nano doesn't use that much current.

# ARMSID firmware 2.16 #
########################

A new firmware update has been released for the ARMSID.

ARMSID is a replacement of the MOS6581 and MOS8580 sound chip used in the
Commodore C64. It is minimalistic (in simplicity of circuit and use, not in
function and power).

The following has been changed in the firmware:

- Fix for 2 MHz mode C128. Since this firmware ARMSID is functional for all
  modes and types of communication with C128 (even those incompatible with
  SID documentation).
- Added to the configuration the possibility to use the EXT IN input (pin 26)
  as an analog input and connect it to the internal mixer, as on the original
  chip. You should expect a slight increase in noise background from this input,
- Also added to the configuration the possibility to change the emulation
  detection threshold of the 6581/8580 according to the input voltage (pin 28),
  so called autodetection. Originally this limit is set to 10.5V, what is below
  indicates 8580 emulation, what is above so 6581. With the new setting, this
  limit can be about 2V, so you can use logic levels of 5V or even just 3V for
  switching the emulation type (pin 28 is not used for power supply in ARMSID,
  only for voltage measurement, no power supply on this pin is required for
  function).

# Prg2Sid 1.20 #
################

Prg2Sid is a tool that attaches a PSID header to a ripped (prg) tune. It
identifies some players and sets init/play accordingly. It also patches
the header and code if needed.

Since 1.15 the following has been changed:

- param 4 only allowed capital "N" for setting NTSC flag, now also lowercase.
- StarBars 1.4: the examples provided in 1.4 are actually made with a previous
  beta version, while the code in the actual composer is slightly different.
  Now both 1.4beta and 1.4 release prgs are correctly identified and patched.
- GRG Tiny4: Workaround to support more variants.
- new players identified:
  DMC 4.x patched (only those needing a patch at $0ff9)
  Anvil
  Whittaker (2 variants)

# SID Known v1.27 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released a new version of SID Known. This version supports now
HVSC #81. SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID
tunes from SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g., you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
