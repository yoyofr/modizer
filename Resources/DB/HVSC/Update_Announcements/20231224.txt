- Added optional parameters Subtunes and StartSong (suggested by Encore/Undone)

  the actual addresses

# Star Bars Atari 2600 Music Editor v1.4 #
##########################################

Star Bars is a music sequencer and play routine for Atari 2600 video game
console from the late 70's made by Alekse Eeben. The editor runs on a C64 and
exports both PAL and NTSC Atari 2600 ROM images containing your music and the
music player code.

Star Bars uses Tiatonic Tuning to achieve 8x improved frequency resolution over
TIA chip au naturel and it can play the full chromatic scale over 6 octaves. No
more awful out-of-tune Atari 2600 bleeps! C-1..F-2 and E-3..F-6 are the most
accurate note ranges. F#2..D#3 and above F#6 are a bit hazy.

Registers are updated up to 32 times per frame, so using Star Bars music in
games or demos is somewhat challenging, yet not impossible.

# SID Known v1.26 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.26. This version supports now HVSC #80.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g., you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
