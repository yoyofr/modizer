 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Welcome to the biggest collection of the POKEY-based Atari XL/XE music.
 The outfit of the whole collection was inspired by the HVSC collection (with 
 some differences). I hope you'll like this collection. To get in touch with 
 us, see the "Contact" section of this document.

 Help!
 ~~~~~
 As you can see, there are lots of songs in the 'Unknown' directory. If
 you can provide us with any missing information about any song (who did it, 
 where does it come from, when was it composed), please let us know
 immediately so that we can complete the information about the song in ASMA
 (and move it to the appropriate directory). We would welcome if you sent us
 also the binary file (or an ATR/XFD disk image) with the original piece of
 software with that song.
