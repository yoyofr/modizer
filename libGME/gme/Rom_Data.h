/* Loads a ROM file into memory and allows access to it in page-sized chunks.

* ROM file consists of header followed by ROM data. Instead of storing the entire
ROM contents, the file only stores the occupied portion, with the bytes before and
after that cleared to some value. The size and format of the header is up to the
caller, as is the starting address of the ROM data following it. File loading is
performed with a single read, rather than two or more that might otherwise be
required.

* Once ROM data is loaded and its address specified, a pointer to any "page" can
be obtained. ROM data is mirrored using smallest power of 2 that contains it.
Addresses not aligned to pages can also be used, but this might cause unexpected
results.

Example with file data of size 0x0C put at address 0x0F, with page size of 8:

---------------0123456789AB--------------------0123456789AB---------...
^       ^       ^       ^       ^       ^       ^       ^       ^   
0     0x08     0x10    0x18    0x20    0x28    0x30    0x38    0x40

at_addr(0x00) = pointer to 8 bytes of fill.
at_addr(0x08) = pointer to 7 bytes of fill, followed by first byte of file.
at_addr(0x10) = pointer to next 8 bytes of file.
at_addr(0x18) = pointer to last 3 bytes of file, followed by 5 bytes of fill.
at_addr(0x20) = pointer to 8 bytes of fill.
at_addr(0x28) = pointer to 7 bytes of fill, followed by first byte of file.
etc. */
