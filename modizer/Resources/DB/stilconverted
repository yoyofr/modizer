/DEMOS/0-9/128_Byte_Blues_BASIC.sid	COMMENT: 'When I first had a look at the 512b/1k Tiny SID compo, I thought it'd\n         be a great way to get back into doing some assembly language on the\n         C=64 (which I haven't done for a long time). I spent a fair amount of\n         time thinking of the best way to reduce the size and decided that one\n         of the best ways would be to really challenge myself and to squeeze\n         some music out of 128 bytes just for fun.\n         I really wanted to feature the nature of the C=64, so I thought about\n         several ways to best store the note and instrument data. After a few\n         sketches, I found that I seemed to be wasting a lot of space trying to\n         store both the note and duration data, so I decided that the best way\n         would be to derive the notes and durations directly from the C=64\n         memory and just index into a basic blues scale and generate some\n         music. It took a bit of playing around with techniques, but I found\n         that utilizing individual bits to step up or down within the scale\n         generated the most musical results. Somewhat of a 1-bit DPCM technique\n         except for successive music notes in a scale instead of successive\n         samples. So, the code basically cycles through the bits which are\n         displayed in the screen memory and uses them to generate the notes.\n         The note duration is set by combining the jiffy clock and the cursor\n         countdown to give some flex to the tempo. I found that staying in one\n         note sequence was boring, so I made it step through two blues scales.\n         I tried to squeeze out more space by removing the low byte of the\n         frequency but found that it either made the music too out of tune or\n         too high in pitch. I also attempted to add a second voice, but ran out\n         of space. I really liked the idea of adding something to watch while\n         it's playing, so the colours change as it is reading through the bytes\n         of screen memory. Rolling the bits of screen memory had the additional\n         benefit that the bytes would return to their original form after\n         passing over them eight times when the sequence repeats. Since the\n         tempo is partially derived from the cursor blink, it is possible to\n         change the tempo while moving the cursor. The sequence of notes can\n         also be modified by typing in the upper portion of the screen.\n         It should sound fine on any C=64 (NTSC/PAL), SID (6581/8580) or good\n         emulator (VICE, PowerPC etc..). I've had great fun working on this\n         piece and hope others have fun listening and playing around with it as\n         well.' (Freaky DNA)\n

When I got the second disk, I realised that the tunes I\n         modified, were not composed for the game parts I used them in.\n         Moreover, they told me that my compositions were a lot better than\n         his!!!

This demo contained a new version\n         of the tune (this sid). He explains how he had made the music two\n         years earlier on some composer like Soundmonitor or something similar.\n         While at a copyparty, someone supposedly stole his music disk which\n         had the tune on it. This was his only copy of the tune. About two\n         months later, the tune appeared on a Papillions' intro and no credit\n         was given to van Santen.

At that time I hadn't any player and I didn't want to spend\n         too much time in making one. I ripped the 20CC player by analyzing the\n         code in assembler. Then I programmed the codeblocks myself to get the\n         Lambada tune right. I laughed when 20CC found out that their player\n         was used and Falco Paul or Edwin van Santen hadn't made that tune\n         earlier!!! They accused me of ripping routines etc. etc. Well.. they\n         were right, I never claimed that it was my player but I merged my\n         Lambada tune blocks via assembler into their old music blocks (I\n         overwrote it). The funniest thing was that the Lambada tune from me\n         was very populair at that time. When 20CC heard it they made their own\n         Lambada tune, hehehehe...' (Patrick Peters)\n

/MUSICIANS/B/Bayliss_Richard/Heavy_Storm.sid	COMMENT: 'I had a tight deadline to write a tune for the Forever 2014 party,\n         although I was too busy working on other things, including Honey Bee.\n         This sound track is a trance style tune, inspired by the Trance\n         Sector loading tune. I tried to immitate some of the instruments that\n         were used in Goat Tracker, in DMC V5.0+, but the result turned out\n         completely different. This tune made it to 11th out 12th place at\n         Forever 2014 party. Best heard on a C64C with 8580 SID :)' (RB)\n

I don't feel all that comfortable using Goat\n         Tracker to make new sounds, because it is more difficult to get the\n         pulse rate and vibrato right.

It was a good learning experience but I wish I had more time to\n         work on the tunes as most of my efforts went into writing the software.\n         I remember listening to the music form The Last Ninja and Wizball at\n         that time, trying to figure out how they created the sounds so I could\n         write my music driver. Martin Galway later told me how he created the\n         high pitched wooden block 'pop' sound, which was achieved by running\n         the driver at 240Hz.' (GB)\n

/MUSICIANS/B/Bjerregaard_Johannes/Thunderforce.sid	COMMENT: 'I wrote most of Thunderforce together with my highschool friend Peter\n         Uhd Jespsen. The game was originally written for the Danish company\n         called Keleline. Peter was a big fan of Depeche Mode and had most of\n         their records. Therefore we wanted to get some tunes from DM in the\n         game. Keleline wrote to DM and first got a yes, but then the group\n         decided no. At least that was the story we were told, but I think,\n         that the director of the company cheated us. Somewhere out there is a\n         small demo, which have the five tunes in it.'\n         (Info from Eric Christensen).

/MUSICIANS/B/Blues_Muz/Gallefoss_Glenn/Ode_to_Bugg.sid	  TITLE: Mystified [from the Amiga MOD module]\n ARTIST: Jogeir Liljedahl\nCOMMENT: Prior to public release, GRG believed this tune was originally done on\n         the Amiga by Liljedahl. According to GRG, when fellow countryman Geir\n         Tjelta heard the SID, Tjelta informed GRG that he thought the original\n         was actually done by Bug (Stein Erik Giske) rather than Liljedahl.\n         Tjelta also informed GRG that Bug passed away in 1992 thus giving GRG\n         inspiration to rename the tune before releasing publicly. Unfortunately\n         Tjelta's credit information was incorrect, however Tjelta does not\n         recall giving GRG incorrect credits perhaps suggesting there was a\n         miscommunication between the two. Another theory is that there may\n         have been confusion between Jogeir's 'Mystified' and one of Bug's\n         tunes named 'Slider' where the first few notes are similar but indeed\n         the two tunes are very different. Reflecting back, Jogeir Liljedahl, a\n         friend and group member of the late Bug, adds the following: 'When it\n         comes to Mystified, it's 100% my original tune. I haven't even thought\n         about the similarities to Bug's Slider tune, but the 5-6 first notes\n         of the song are similar to Mystified. But it's a completely different\n         song of course. Either me or Bug noticed that back then, and Bug was\n         a huge fan of Mystified, since he was among the first to hear the song\n         (along with Olav Rasmus Vorren aka Shorty).'\n

Why is that? Well,\n         the info says (C)1994 Caution, (C)1995 Amorphis but actually the tune\n         doesn't belong to any of these groups, right? It is a mix of\n         originally someone's else work. The (C) sign there is merely just an\n         indication of what groups released, or used this tune.

/MUSICIANS/B/Brennan_Neil/	COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Brennan to be his.\n         The HVSC team via their sources have checked all the original credits\n         and found that most of the tunes that were supposedly done by Greg\n         Holland were in fact made by Neil Brennan. For most of the games Greg\n         Holland was the graphic artist rather than the composer. The HVSC Crew\n         also has confirmation of this fact from a senior employee of Beam\n         Software, who was on Melbourne House's main programming team at the\n         time. Brennan's own comments are denoted (NB).\n         'The only musician I knew at Melbourne House pre-me (I think I started\n         in 1983) was Adrian Pertout. A guy named Gavin Anderson (I think) came\n         after me, but I lost contact with that company fairly quickly, so I'm\n         a pretty poor source of information.' (NB)\n

Therefore I added sum of my music\n         style to the tune, that's why it sounds a bit techno like.. Try to\n         enjoy this tune with a stereo, you'll like it I guess.. By the way\n         remember that all C128 computers have a different filter set on their\n         sid chips,so the music sounds a bit different than on normal C64\n         computers, you'll hear the difference on the bass, the filters doesn't\n         open theirselves so much on C128! But who the fuck cares, this music\n         runs on all computers, that's what counts! [...]'\n         (Taken from a note added to the tune 'Positive' by Chotaire himself)\n

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Airwolf.sid	  TITLE: Airwolf Theme [from the TV series]\n ARTIST: Sylvester Levay\nCOMMENT: 'When I was interviewed by Brian Wilcox at Elite for a job they sent\n         me home with a little task to prove that I had some computer and\n         progamming skills. The task was to make the Oric Atmos computer I had\n         at home play the theme tune to Airwolf. Over the weekend I managed to\n         get the tune playing using a very simple assembler that I had written\n         in basic. As a result I got the job at Elite and the first thing they\n         had me doing was programming the Airwolf tune on the C64 as they were\n         doing a game based on the TV show. After this I found myself doing\n         music all the time and that is how I got started.' (MC)\n
/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Airwolf_II.sid	COMMENT: Heavily inspired by Harold Faltermeyer's Axel F.\n         'This is a rather peculiar tune, I can't remember anything about this\n         game really, must be based on a helicopter (but not necessarily so\n         knowing elite). The tune sounds vaguely Egyptian or Arabic.' (MC)\n
/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Battle_Island.sid	COMMENT: 'I never saw this game, I received a phone call and was asked to do\n         the music. I had a feeling though that the game might be a bit like\n         Commando so I did a tune that was kind of inspired by Rob Hubbard's\n         music for that game. Of course it's nowhere near as good as maestro\n         Rob's tune but it's certainly not the worst tune I ever did.' (MC)\n
/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Battle_Ships.sid	COMMENT: 'This game was based on the well known board game. Tune 2 is a weird\n         victory ditty that was composed by my brother. Tune 3 I think is the\n         highscore music and tune 4 is the ingame music, just a 2 channel\n         ambient track which left 1 channel for sfx. Tune 5 seems to be corrupt\n         and out of sync for some reason but was meant to be used for action\n         parts of the game.' (MC)\n
/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Bomb_Jack.sid	COMMENT: Does not cover the arcade version.\n         'Bombjack 1 was based on the old coin op machine.\n         The title tune is a Jean-Michel Jarre cover. We used to copy tunes\n         like this all the time in the early days, I think the legislation at\n         the time didn't cover computer based music, that situation didn't last\n         very long though and we then needed to do original compositions\n         (supposedly).

We had a private pre-release screening\n         of Gremlins II in their mini cinema, kitted out with surround sound.\n         The computer press were invited and Steve Wilcox gave a talk before\n         the film was screened. After wards we went to a Thai restaurant but\n         being a potatoes & gravy man I passed on the food and hot footed it\n         home. Worryingly, listening to the music I'm not 100% sure if I did it\n         or not. I think I did cause certain elements sound like my music but\n         the highscore tune (No 6) sounds far too good.

This was due to the fact that my routine\n         didn't contain a fractional timer at that point. Speeds were\n         determined by the shortest note length which could be 1,2,3 or 4 etc.\n         The speed differences were thus 100%, 50,33% etc. with no in between\n         values. The rest of the tunes in the set are original compositions I\n         think, maybe tune 2 was close to the arcade version.'

Tune 4 is an action type\n         tune, tune 5 is a durge, tune 6 is game over, tune 7 is a dancey\n         highscore tune and tune 8 is another ingame tune.' (MC)\n

Due to this lack of knowledge, this can't be heard\n         when played on a real C64 (with 2 SID chips) or on recent versions of\n         Vice. A pity, as I don't have the source module any more. :(' (OC)\n

/MUSICIANS/D/Danko_Tomas/Shock_Magazine.sid	  TITLE: Rubicon, Tune #1\n ARTIST: Jeroen Tel\nCOMMENT: 'They wanted a title-theme for Shock Magazine, and gave me the first\n         issue. There was a song in there, and I had no clue what it really\n         was but thought it captured the feel of the entire magazine. So I\n         simply made a cover of it, Danko style. I never had any hangups about\n         having to do it all, music is all about sharing and developing ideas\n         together in order to reach higher grounds. The chords aren't\n         identical to Jeroen's version, in fact we had a little thing over\n         that at a party in Oslo back in '94 or so. We hung over a keyboard\n         and I played the chords my style, and he went like 'No! It's like\n         THIS!' and I said 'Well, I want it THIS way!'. *grin* One of the guys\n         at the party leaned over to me and whispered that he in fact\n         preferred my version of the track. *smirk* Jeroen superimposed a sus2\n         chord throughout the progression until it folds back to the tonic,\n         where the sus2 becomes a m7. It's a nice move, one that I personally\n         use quite a lot myself. But this time around I expanded the\n         progression to plain chords following the bassline.\n         After I had done the tune I found out that it was from Rubicon, but\n         to me it doesn't matter.\n         Later on I made a remix of it, called it Schizomix, with weird\n         sounds. Because Rubicon had been a double-speed song, or something\n         similar, I wanted to make weird and similar sounds but in a single-\n         speed player. And that's all it was, a messed up version of my first\n         cover so to speak.' (TD)\n

/MUSICIANS/D/Detert_Thomas/Gordian_Tomb.sid	COMMENT: 'After we got the contract [for Gordian Tomb] with a good value of\n         money, we discussed how to divide it to the people. This was a mess.\n         We at least lost some days of programming. Michael [Detert] was\n         menacing with a dropout if Thomas didn't compose the music. So I\n         thought ok, we are a team and I am busy with programming - why not?\n         But then we couldn't unite about the amount of money. Thomas should\n         get the twice of a normal level for a salary. If I had been a better\n         businessman these days I had done everything by myself, but at least\n         we had a great time and a lot of fun. And the teamwork was always\n         accurate. Finally Thomas had known that the salary was overdrawn and\n         he repaid every dollar with the longest music ever [32:06 minutes] on\n         commodore 64.' (Info from Markus Schneider).\n(#1)\nCOMMENT: The original release has a protection which overlaps a fraction of\n         the music data, causing dirty sounds in this tune (most notably, the\n         bass). The game was also released without protection and with correct\n         data, which is present in this rip.\n

/MUSICIANS/E/ELA/Stoff_Deboot.sid	COMMENT: 'One of the reasons I got to join The Suppliers (who were quite big\n         back then) was this tune. It was first made with Rockmonitor II (which\n         was what they liked), but it took way too much raster to be useable in\n         a demo so I made this one in FutureComposer. It was never used\n         (something I got used to later). I still think the original sounds\n         better. The title has nothing to do with drugs btw. It's just some\n         words that fell into my head when I typed the savename.' (ELA)\n

I was going to University of Waterloo at the time and just\n         gave it to a friend of mine... didn't even bother to put my name on\n         the thing. Anyway it soon started cropping up all over the place.\n         I never made any sequels with music, although there was something with\n         annoying sound effects done in the same style as Synth Sample that I\n         posted in the beginning of 1994. So any music you see that looks like\n         a sequel or has graphics added was done by someone else.\n         Anyway the computer bust of 85/86(?) hit and Synth was never marketed.\n         I had been negotiating with a software company but they went out of\n         business. By that time I was working on a new version of Synth that\n         was a sequencer program for Midi instruments (called MSS), and had\n         joined my first band. I've been in a couple other bands since then,\n         the last one was called SugarPush and we came close to getting signed\n         (but then broke up [...]).

OK, I admit it... It was a drum synthesizer package\n         called Digidrums, actually, so you could still say I was the first to\n         include samples in a piece of music. [...] Never would I claim to have\n         invented that technique, I just got it published first. In fact, I\n         couldn't really figure out where they got the sample data, just that\n         they were wiggling the volume register, so I tried to make up my own\n         drum sample sounds in realtime - which is the flatulence stuff that\n         shipped in 'Arkanoid'. [...] After the project was in the shops I\n         gained access to some real drum samples, and I slid those into my own\n         custom version of the tune. The one that's in the shops is kind of a\n         collage of farts & burps, don't you think?

I had been handed 'Miami\n         Vice' and 'Highlander' because the outside development team working on\n         it hadn't worked out who was going to do the sound (notice those games\n         have little or no sound-effects), so I did my best in a very short\n         time. I [...] picked 'The Chase' and the 'Main Theme' as the two tunes\n         I would do. We had settled on two modes for the game - in your car and\n         out of it I think. (Or maybe it was in the game and out of it, I can't\n         remember.) I started on 'The Chase' and if you listen to the first few\n         seconds of that you can hear the basis of that super-filter-echo tune\n         that is so cool. I recall David Collier was sitting in the office with\n         me while I was working on it. But while messing with it while everyone\n         else was at lunch, I came across this cool sound. I added to it and\n         added to it, and when we applied the non-sync'd filter sweep we both\n         flipped out! I decided to abandon the conversion of that tune and\n         simply go with the cool sounds I had stumbled upon. When the guys came\n         back from lunch and listened to it they swore that there was a\n         cassette deck connected somewhere and it wasn't the C64 playing it!\n         Such a sound had not been heard before by any of us out of the C64. So\n         I extended it and turned it into this tripping-out 11-minute piece.\n         The main theme itself... I simply did my best with no drums (Rob\n         Hubbard's strength). I think my strength with guitar solos helped pull\n         it off. Both of those problematic games benefited from my music,\n         actually, and the Ocean management were very relieved\n         (understatement).'

I simply reworked an older piece.\n         After that I _really_ didn't have time to mess with it, and it stuck\n         in universal use. Rambo was the only one that got its own loading\n         music as part of this plan.' (MG)\n         This version was in use for many Ocean/Imagine games from late 1985 to\n         mid 1987.\n
/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Parallax.sid	COMMENT: Before starting on this game Galway bought Rendez-Vous (by Jean Michel\n         Jarre). He listened to it daily. His CD player broke 2 weeks later and\n         didn't get repaired for 2 months, during which time Martin worked on\n         Parallax, without realizing that Rendez-Vous was unconsciously\n         creeping into the music. He realized it only after he played the album\n         again after the game was already shipped.\n         '[Parallax] was 11 minutes long, certainly my longest at the time. I\n         took my development gear home to work on it for a week or two. I just\n         said to myself 'OK, it's going to be this mega-tune, so the intro has\n         to be mega'. The intro took up two-thirds of the tune! I actually got\n         bored with it, and stuck that silly melody on the end which doesn't\n         really match. Going back I would have made it less melodic. I wanted\n         to reflect the gigantic visual proportions represented by the parallax\n         effect in the game so that's why it has an 'epic' feel.'(MG)\n(#1)\n  TITLE: Rendez-Vous [from Rendez-Vous]\n ARTIST: Jean Michel Jarre\n

(Was it around September-1987?)\n         The arcade game didn't have any music on the 'press start' screen, so\n         it would have been a natural for an original tune.

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Street_Hawk.sid	COMMENT: 'The game was re-assigned in early 1986 to Comic Bakery's programmer\n         Colin Gresty and artist Steve Wahid, and they enthusiastically got\n         to work on it, coming up with an all-new approach with nicer\n         graphics - more like the early Grand Theft Auto games (top-down viewed\n         from a chase camera).

While my particular SID sounded great, others\n         were not like it at all and the solos were almost inaudible! At the\n         other extreme the new C64C's were coming out and this filter\n         unreliability had been fixed as part of a silicon revision. BUT the\n         filters were way too open all the time and you could hardly hear any\n         filtering! This caused the filtered note to come out a lot louder than\n         it should have and 'stick out' rather unattractively. So I developed a\n         'filter adjustment' parameter for my music program which would allow\n         the customer to control this filter unreliability and get their\n         particular machine to sound cool.

It took four weeks to complete, including an almost\n         two-week pause in the middle when the Great Storm of 1987 struck the\n         UK, leaving us without electricity or heating for about ten or eleven\n         days.

It basically took from mid-January until\n         early April to finish. It's about as big a project as you would want to\n         undertake, but everything just seemed to work without any real hitches.\n         I was given a fairly free hand to produce what I thought would be most\n         suitable and luckily, every time I took in new tracks for each level, I\n         got the thumbs up. It was a great time for me personally, to suddenly\n         be working full time on C64 music. I was almost 18, but I had no real\n         worries in the world beyond whether I could afford to buy a better car.\n         I think the entire The Last Ninja 2 soundtrack is my proudest\n         achievement, especially the Central Park tracks, as they seem to mean\n         so much to so many people. The project itself was a pleasure to be part\n         of. The whole team involved were probably at the top of their C64 game\n         at the time, from John's programming to Hugh's fantastic graphics,\n         Tim's storyboarding and of course Mark's overall vision and commitment.\n         It's amazing that we're still talking about it nearly 30 years on.'\n         (MDG)\n(#1)\n   NAME: Central Park (loader)\n(#2)\n   NAME: Central Park (in-game)\n(#3)\n   NAME: The Street (loader)\n(#4)\n   NAME: The Street (in-game)\n(#5)\n   NAME: The Sewers (loader)\n(#6)\n   NAME: The Sewers (in-game)\n  TITLE: Kentilla (3:31-6:08)\n ARTIST: Rob Hubbard\nCOMMENT: Only the part from 6:10-8:36 in Kentilla is covered here, mostly the\n         bassline of it.

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Professional_BMX_Simulator.sid	COMMENT: 'BMX Simulator II, also for Codemasters and also known as Pro BMX, was\n         a very quick track to do  it had to be, as it was needed in a hurry.\n         It has since taken on a life of its own on the demo scene, though\n         apparently, not many people knew it was one of mine.' (MDG)\n         Later reused in game 'Ninja Massacre', (C) 1989 Codemasters.\n
/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Quedex.sid	COMMENT: 'Paul Docherty and/or Graham Hunter passed one of my CNet demos on to\n         Paul Cooper at Thalamus. They wanted to use it for the loading\n         sequence, but it had been written on Soundmonitor. Somehow, they\n         managed to get it to play while the game loaded. The in-game tunes\n         needed to be written in such a way that if a sound effect played,\n         it didn't destroy the music too much. Stavros Fasoulas and Paul Cooper\n         drove up to my parents' house where I basically had the top floor of\n         a bungalow to myself. Stavros loaded up his game demos and went\n         through what was needed. I think it took me about two weeks to do all\n         the tunes and FX. Working for such a big name in the industry\n         definitely opened up more doors.'

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Treasure_Island_Dizzy.sid	COMMENT: 'On Treasure Island Dizzy, also for Codemasters, the title theme was my\n         version of the original Dizzy music, and the in-game tune had a rhythm\n         in 12ths with a heavy swing. I liked the arpeggio chords in it. I also\n         like the high score tune, for some reason. I later converted these to\n         the NES.'

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Tusker.sid	COMMENT: 'Tusker, also for System 3, was an interesting production because I'd\n         heard Rob Hubbard create a sound like crickets in the grass or jungle\n         on Flash Gordon, so I created a similar sound which was great for the\n         general atmosphere on Tusker. The drums and rhythms were also very\n         important in this game. There needed to be a tribal sound overall, and\n         I think I managed that. I think I spent about four or five weeks on\n         this game.'

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Vendetta.sid	COMMENT: 'In 1989, I did Vendetta for System 3. The first track I did for this\n         was a cover of Infected by The The. Paul Docherty introduced me to it\n         as a reference, but I took it a little too literally. I had to make a\n         lot of use of the filters on this game, to keep the mood. This was\n         actually my last game for System 3, sometime around March 1989. I\n         think the Maniacs of Noise had rolled into town by then!'

It was what it was, but in hindsight,\n         I'm amazed I got any other offers after those two efforts!' (MDG)\n

His\n         goal was to see if his dismal creation could score higher than some of\n         the real competitors proving the system was a complete farce. For this\n         particular competition, SymMek98, Greatrix's tune rightfully finished\n         last.\n

After Antti Kangas (Scorpion) finished\n         his first music routine for Artline Designs (ALD) we started to\n         release 'quality-sounds'.  Before ALD I was the founder member of\n         Contex.  All tunes were composed with an assembler.' (AH)\n
/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/ATA.sid	COMMENT: 'Released in 1992, made with ALD-player v3.0 which was developed late\n         1990. The routine turned out to be the one I used most, though v3.7\n         was even ready at the time.\n         The tune itself was the first one I was asked to do for a game. ATA\n         was a Tetris-clone done by German Lower Level and I don't recall if I\n         got paid for the track, but anyway it was liked by the authors and\n         apparently many others.\n         This must have been the best track I've done if I don't take count on\n         my new tunes. I wasn't anymore much into composing that time, I just\n         composed as a time-killer. Also a high score track was included.' (AH)\n

V2.1 didn't have any pulse data for $41 sounds so therefore\n         I just used $11 or $21 to have acceptable melody-sounds.\n         I was just playing around with the routine and somehow the Zone-theme\n         appeared into my mind, but it's only influenced by the theme and the\n         rest of the tune was just an effort of imagination.\n         Done in January/February 1990.'

The B-Ball track however, never got\n         released as the game wasn't sold (I guess). I liked this track a lot\n         myself and in fact it was the first time I had to do jingles.

This was the problem:\n         the drum sounds worked, but all the other instrument sounds were\n         screwed - basically it resulted in this horrible screeching noise\n         playing to drums, rather than the cool heavyish sound that was heard\n         in the final version of the game. It sounded really harsh and so it\n         was duly shot down by us in the review. I remember hearing the\n         'proper' version of the game at a later dater and thinking 'ooooops!'.\n         After all it was a classic tune (it became one of my faves, indeed)\n         and we'd mercilessly beaten it down in the review, which was totally\n         unfair.

/MUSICIANS/H/Huelsbeck_Chris/R-Type.sid	COMMENT: Very interesting story here. Katakis was released in September 1988 by\n         Rainbow Arts, however it never got a release in the UK as Activision\n         had it cancelled because of similarities to R-Type, to which\n         Activision had bought the conversion rights. Activision were getting\n         nowhere with their conversion of R-Type and they liked what they saw\n         of Katakis, so they hired the same programming team (Manfred Trenz and\n         others) to do the C64 conversion. They only got 6 weeks to write the\n         conversion, and sadly, it shows. Katakis was eventually altered and\n         released as Denaris in 1989.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Double_speed.sid	COMMENT: This is the only quickspeed tune not made in v17.Q0. It was made in\n         1989, some time before Jeroen Tel made his first quatro-tune for\n         'Invest'. However, the idea was not new at that time. In the\n         mid-eighties Tony Crowther experimented with quatro players in games\n         such as 'Zig Zag'. My double speed tune, however, used the ordinary v9\n         player and was simply called twice a frame.\n         Composed in JCH player v9.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Duchesse.sid	COMMENT: Composed in JCH player v13, tune length is 2:18.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Easy_does_it.sid	COMMENT: Notice how I put real synthesizer chords into the digi voice. That was\n         not done very often on the Commodore 64 - musicians normally used this\n         channel for bass and drums only. The tune makes extensive use of ring\n         modulation effects and was used in a 'Pretzel Logic' demo.\n         Composed in JCH digiplayer, tune length is 2:02.\n

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Fiasko_2.sid	COMMENT: This was in fact the first suggestion to the 'Oswald' game. I played\n         the tune to the programmer and graphician of the game but they didn't\n         like it. They loved the next attempt however, which you can find as\n         'Super_Oswald.sid'.\n         Composed in JCH player v10.G1, tune length is 0:24.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Forever_Cry.sid	COMMENT: Composed in JCH player v13, tune length is 1:22.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/George_Carl.sid	COMMENT: A long tune containing three completely different parts. The slow\n         introduction changes at 01:19 to a part which was played by the clown\n         George Carl during his shows. Here I tried to emulate a real mouth\n         organ using ring modulation.\n         Composed in JCH player v13.\n

I completed the conversion for the ridiculous sum of money.\n         Later, 'DRAX' admitted that he didn't complete the conversion because\n         he thought the original Amiga music was boring.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Shift.sid	COMMENT: A worktune that wasn't finished. Due to the fact that we have reached\n         1991, my Korg M1 was a reality. This tune was totally composed on the\n         keyboard first, apart from the digi voice which was added later using\n         the editor alone. The digi voice doesn't appear until 01:16 - it was\n         supposed to be a 'surprise' tune.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Skaermtrolden_Hugo.sid	  TITLE: Hugo Rap Theme\n ARTIST: <?>\nCOMMENT: A professional software house in Denmark called 'SilverRock' gained a\n         lot of success with 'Hugo' in danish television. This troll could be\n         controlled in a game using telephone buttons. A very new concept which\n         soon became enormously popular. During the success of the troll, a\n         real musician produced a CD containing a rap hit where Hugo was\n         singing using the typical voice which was also used in the game. As\n         the game was converted for sales versions from the Amiga to PC and\n         C64, I did the C64 song converted from the Danish rap hit.\n         Composed in JCH player v17, tune length is 1:24.\n

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Tecnetium.sid	COMMENT: I always get mixed feelings when I play this music. The title- tune is\n         long and I put a lot of work into it in april 1989, but today I can\n         hear loads of harmonic errors here and there. The game was done for a\n         sideways shoot'em up which a couple of totally unknown danish guys was\n         making. They soon lost all interest in their game, however. The\n         hiscore theme was a conversion of the old Cliff Richard hit\n         'Congratulations' done right out my head. I always wanted to make such\n         a hiscore tune, because I always thought Rob Hubbard did it all wrong\n         when he made 'sad' hiscore tunes.

Unfortunately,\n         we forgot to test the tune on a real machine - and it was crucial,\n         because strange filter settings make this one sound COMPLETELY\n         BROKEN on C64. The title appears to fit perfectly in this case, I\n         think. No wonder it was voted that low: 17th out of 19 at North\n         Party 8 in 2003. So, use SIDPlay2/w.'

I very quickly got annoyed with the\n         unresponsiveness of the editor when trying to play sounds at this\n         rate.  But I *do* like working with the sounds at these sort of update\n         rates, so I'm working on a player which takes a smaller amount of\n         raster time than TFX to use for such music.

I was\n         losing my mind, and this music represents that.\n         The full verse is 'Blood, Starlight, Rain like tears, Drink from\n         this, and let go the years'.  I don't know who penned those words, but\n         I dropped the latter half from the title because I promised said girl\n         that I would.\n         This music was made on an emulator (vice 1.8, and of course I had\n         resid turned on :-p).

The second half is mostly an\n         experiment in what happens when you mix diffrent types of Ringmod and\n         Sync effects, which I like the sound of.  Sidplay1 hates it. It was\n         originally intended to sound quite different from this, because the\n         original sketch for it required a dyanmic wave table, but I got fed up\n         waiting for that, and finished it as is.'

Anyhow, around\n         2 minutes after I sat down at the editor, it instead became something\n         else (I hate it when that happens :-p), which basically amounts to an\n         attempt to place what was goes through my mind at the time into sid\n         form... the evolution of my soul.  I achieved that, I think, which is\n         probably why almost no-one else understands it.

I\n         originally tried to do this in sid duzz it in early 1999, but the\n         number of arpeggio commands required for the places where there is\n         two leads in one channel, and the blips in the drum/bass channel,\n         overwelmed that editor.  So I tried in JCH v20g4, where I had managed\n         to succed with Sunset Spirals, due to the ability it has to change the\n         wavetable from within a song, but this too was not to be, due to the\n         limitations of the editor.  So, I started writing a new editor, which\n         was specifically designed to handle this situation, by splitting each\n         channel into six virtual channels, and using special rules to modulate\n         them together.  But this took up a lot of ram and raster time, indeed\n         it too so much ram in the editor that I could only store five patterns\n         at a time, so this was not to be either.  So Ray introduced me to TFX,\n         and I asked him about changing the wave table from within the song,\n         but he wouldn't have this, because it would confuse people, but he\n         suggested a viable alternative, which is to support variables in the\n         wave table, and promised to add this feature asap.  That was January\n         2001, but he was too busy to implement them for the next two and a\n         half years.  So I started bugging him to just give me the source and\n         the bits to build it, and in November 2003,  he did.  So, I put my\n         money where my mouth was, and added that feature (and a bunch of\n         others which I had been wanting for a long time), and I was _finally_\n         able to do a version of this that I happy with.  To anyone else but\n         me, this is just another mediocre game tune, but for me it was an\n         achievement.' (JJ)\n

So, my\n         version is crap too, but I think it has the nice harmonies in the\n         second half, at least, and I think is a little less crap than his :).'\n         (JJ)\n

I had the S3M of this kicking around, and so\n         I covered it to learn the editor.  The instruments suck... I never was\n         good at making percussion, and unfortunantly there isn't any good ones\n         around made in TFX to rip.  I also had basically zero understanding of\n         how the wave tables worked when I did this, and as a result there are\n         some very stupid things in there which sound terrible ;).  This\n         probably should never have been released, but people liked it for\n         reasons that I don't understand.\n         As it turned out, the instruments sounded so crap partially because\n         Ray's player was horrifically bugged, at the time.

/MUSICIANS/K/Kawasaki_Ryo/	COMMENT: Ryo Kawasaki's own comments are denoted (RK).\n         'When the first time Commodore 64 computer hit the market in 1984, I\n         rushed to buy it by paying $600 at some electronic store on 45th\n         street in Manhattan. It was 8-bit with only 64KB of memory. Then I\n         spent two years to write these four programs as well as unpublished\n         Midi-Workstation (8-track real-time Midi recorder) all by machine\n         code using SuperMon without assembler so that it runs fast and leave\n         enough memory for music data. Each of these programs was sold for\n         $49.95 in retail stores furnished with handsome package came with\n         5-inch floppy disk and manual. In 15 years, now we can buy 1GHz PC\n         for the same price as I bought my first C64. And I wonder what kind\n         of computer we can buy 15 years from now by paying $600?' (RK)\n

This rip has the filter enabled.\n(#1)\n  TITLE: Soul Fanfare [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#2)\n  TITLE: Cyberfunk [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#3)\n  TITLE: Rock Piano [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#4)\n  TITLE: Dave's Love [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#5)\n  TITLE: Mallet Mood [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#6)\n  TITLE: Switched On Link [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#7)\n  TITLE: Soul Minuet [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#8)\n  TITLE: Peaceful Evening [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#9)\n  TITLE: The Elven King [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#10)\n  TITLE: Mighty Tension [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#11)\n  TITLE: Witching Hour [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#12)\n  TITLE: Dying Forest [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#13)\n  TITLE: The Eremit's Tale [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#14)\n  TITLE: Deserted Caverns [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#15)\n  TITLE: Former Glory [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#16)\n  TITLE: Secret Chambers [from the Amiga game Soul Crystal]\n ARTIST: Chris Link\n(#17)\n  TITLE: Funeral March [from Sonate No. 2 in B flat minor Op. 35] (0:00-0:28)\n ARTIST: Frédéric François Chopin\nCOMMENT: Covers 'Death Tune' from the Amiga version of the game, by Chris Link.\n

Since having no sequencer or other audio gear\n         except my Roland M5, I started doing c64 sids using a program called\n         AMP. It allowed to compose in a tracker-like environment, and had a\n         nice interface for creating sounds. I tried to learn several techniques\n         by covering Hubbard's Commando, but my best sid was a cover of Moroder's\n         Midnight Express.' (LMan)\n

It's a very sad song with a simple melody, supported by a\n         solemn yet rhythmical accompaniment written by Mahoney. If you're a\n         SID composer, you know that when you get a song stuck on your mind,\n         it inevitably ends up as a SID tune. =) In this case, I've tried to\n         stick to Mahoney's arrangement as far as possible.'

Syndrom liked this tune so much\n         that he did a 90% copy of it.

/MUSICIANS/M/Mueller_Markus/Coco_Intro.sid	COMMENT: Both Edwin van Santen and Markus Müller have claimed ownership of\n         this tune, but due to the fact that Markus Müller vividly\n         remembers even tiny details about it, and that Edwin van Santen\n         never released any Soundmonitor tunes, it seems more likely it is in\n         fact Müller's. Sadly, with Edwin van Santen having passed away, we\n         may never know the complete story behind it.\n         Also see /MUSICIANS/0-9/20CC/van_Santen_Edwin/Vlindertjes.sid\n

/MUSICIANS/O/Omoroca/1_Omega.sid	COMMENT: 'This tune marks the beginning of a new era of my personal development\n         as a musician.

/MUSICIANS/O/Omoroca/Grave.sid	COMMENT: 'This is the SID I'm most proud of. The tune was also recorded later\n         as 'Patty, Kim & Gunnar' with keyboards and vocals and had the title\n         'Just Good Friends'. It was 'covered' in 1996 by Dieter Bohlen, who\n         we had sent a demo tape to, and released in 1996 as Blue System's\n         single 'Only With You' and on his album 'Body To Body'.

/MUSICIANS/O/Omoroca/K_I_M.sid	COMMENT: 'I wrote this as a love song for a girl named Kim, at least I thought\n         so.

Weeks later I found\n         out that the girl's name wasn't Kim at all, but I didn't change the\n         title of this tune to her real name. Mind the funny ping-pong sound\n         starting at 3:09! ;-)' (KH)\n
/MUSICIANS/O/Omoroca/Kirchenlied.sid	COMMENT: 'Just a small sound study.' (KH)\n
/MUSICIANS/O/Omoroca/La_Serenada.sid	COMMENT: 'With this elaborate composition, I ran out of memory very quickly. At\n         1:41-1:45 I frivolously used a 'forbidden' memory part, so the music\n         data is overwritten during the initialization of the tune's playback\n         by the drums samples. Bummer! Tune inspired by Rondo Veneziano.' (KH)\n

/MUSICIANS/O/Omoroca/Medusa.sid	COMMENT: 'My first tune with digidrums, which I had ripped from the game\n         'Danger Freak'. This tune marks a turning-point in my personal\n         development as a musician, putting the focus more on harmonies and\n         elaborate arpeggios than trying to produce a 'cool sound'. From this\n         tune on, I also made myself a strict rule that I FIRST finish\n         composing the tune on my piano or my Casio keyboard and THEN switch\n         the C128 on and start with the data input. In order to reflect this,\n         I also started to give the tunes names instead of numbers again.' (KH)\n

One of my costly and longest LSD\n         tracks. in this routine I could trigger demoparts with numeric\n         commands in the soundpattern, Quiss (the programmer of LSD and some\n         of the trackmoparts in Mathematica) have included a fallback routine\n         in the demo, that waits 10 sec if the floppydrive of the user is to\n         slow and a trigger was missed. Unfortunately he forgot to tell me that\n         the first numeric trigger he was expecting was a '0'. But I began the\n         count with '1' ... so 10 sec failbackpause is in all versions of\n         mathematica, right before the Doom-part. Funny thing: exact 5.34 min\n         long was the centerpart, I composed exact 5.34 min :)  but I don't\n         know about the 10 sec fall back routine, and Quiss didn't tell me...\n         he simply took notice that the music was too 'short', removed the\n         stop-bytes at the end of the LSD track and was satisfied. Watching\n         the trackmo first time and live at THE PARTY'95 I was pissed of as\n         I saw/heard the result: the music wild remixed itself after 5.34\n         unless the last part was finished. I learned one thing:\n         (its true up to now, 2008!!) programmers don't have any savvy about\n         music.  Last funny thing: I asked all people around me what they\n         thought about this crazy and disharmonic music?  All(!) comments\n         sounded like this: 'If PVCF compose like this it has to be like\n         this' ... aha.. ha ..ha... Funny thing: after the democompetition\n         the organizers have shown this trackmo again, in this time (1995)\n         Mathematica was like a revolution on C64 in design & code and I\n         put in at 1:36 a little irish sounding melody which forced some\n         people with hooked arms to dance together on tables, I was very\n         very very proud :p  It's possible that you need a new sidchip to\n         hear this part, sorry for that. (yes, the trackmo has a\n         sidchip-selector and detector, but this should be used in an other\n         trackmo of us, read the STIL comments for\n         Mathematica_tune_1_6581.sid for more information about this).'

But after about 8 hours of composing on my\n         C64 (it was a sunny day, I ought to learn for my A-level examination)\n         the C64 was freezed (a DMC-crash which occured about once per year).\n         After that I was so frustrated that I released this truly unfinished\n         version. Check out the great mp3 conversion from DJ SKITZ. To be\n         honest I have ripped out the idea for the filtered glide effect in\n         the main bassline from an Amiga-mod called 'Megasweet'. I thought\n         it would be nice to try something similar on C64 for testing purpose.\n         Then I added the chord, but didn't play it as arpeggio-sound (typical\n         C64), instead I played it like a triad, very slow and voila - the\n         base idea of the first real trance/chill techno music on C64 was\n         born. Now the 'work' begun: in DMC4 doesn't exists a filtercommand\n         in pattern, so I must use different filtered basses and endless\n         glide-effects in bassline. It's not much fun to work like this.' (PVCF)\n

So the old sid wasn't\n         that much of a problem :)\n         It's a DMC music and I hate it for the 16 slots instrument\n         limitation, you can hear it: the filter doesn't sweep smooth at the\n         first part, they are like triggered in a mod file. :( Later I\n         released this song in one of our Brainbeat music collections, but\n         I forgot to relocate the song, so every one could load the tune\n         directly in his DMC. The result: some very bad remixes (which uses\n         this horrible filter off-set soundsystem). The party [the demo was\n         released on] had a limitation in length of demos: 5 minutes. So first\n         I composed the music as a 5 minutes track. Unfortunately Quiss (the\n         coder of the trackmo) didn't get enough parts in time to fill up\n         the 5 minutes complete. We first have planned to show during the\n         whole demo a backward timer which runs from 5 min to 0 with the\n         comment 'We hate timelimits!!!'. After Quiss told me the lack of a\n         needed last part I shortened the music drastically. I have done this\n         track on a new sidchip, KB/TOM (now farbrausch) later converted\n         this song for the old sidchip and released a 'old sid chip' version\n         of the trackmo.'

/MUSICIANS/S/SIDwave/Mixed_Emotions.sid	COMMENT: 'That's exactly what my emotions were as I used this tune in my last\n         demo, on the last screen. It was the Dexion-party in 1988. I had\n         released 'Apolloguys' the same day, and I had bought my Amiga 500 only\n         2 weeks before coming to this party. The first screen featured 'Like\n         Galway', and me writing a lot of text about who and what 'rambones'\n         was. The middle screen was the 'Amiga Noid' screen, with a small\n         picture of an Amiga, and a scroll telling that TST would soon rule it.\n         The last one, with this music, was a 10 point list of things about the\n         C64 that bored the hell out of me. Things like colorbars, sprites\n         moving in sinus, Hubbard alike drums/routines, all with the same sound\n         and generally everything that was in at that time. For me it was sad\n         to see a large variety of composers using more or less the same\n         routine, leaving the music in a grey state. I admire the sound of Fred\n         Gray, Martin Galway, Rob Hubbard, David Whittaker, Ben Daglish and\n         Antony Crowther, and any other programmer that built it all up from\n         scratch.'

I was fairly pleased\n         with the result, it sounds quite uncomfortable on headphones. The tune\n         was written on a SoedeSoft editor, which explains the rather fuzzy\n         triggering and messy drum sounds, but gliding and filter control was\n         much more versatile than anything else around at the time, I felt, and\n         you could sustain notes for about 5 hours.

Let's face it, Neil Baldwin did the best C64 version of this\n         ever, and it was foolish to try and emulate it... This was done on\n         SoedeSoft (I think) at 5am on the Sunday morning of the 1989 PC Show\n         in London (hence the demo title). Has a long ending after a drum solo\n         that John Bonham would probably laugh at. I also did a version of this\n         tune in Ubiks Music in 1988, which was even worse. I hope that's never\n         found!' (BH)\n

It was never\n         meant to be released but we ended up sticking in on an SG demo disk\n         anyway. Note that one of the arpeggios is a bit wonky, and I couldn't\n         be bothered to do the start of the piece, but I felt that it was a\n         pretty good sound-a-like.' (BH)\n
/MUSICIANS/S/Sonic_Graffiti/Hayes_Ben/Greed_Monster.sid	COMMENT: 'Another day, another pointless budget game. Yogi Bear deserved\n         better! I can't remember if I composed the tune or if it was a\n         conversion of some Atari ST music, written by some bloke who's name I\n         can't remember. We used to do a few conversions back then. These were\n         great fun to do. The software company would sent Gerard Gourley a copy\n         of the original music, usually recorded on a cassette recorder sitting\n         by the TV. He'd then play the tune down the telephone to me, and I'd\n         record it on another cassette from the telephone's earpiece. The\n         resulting hi-fidelity master recording would then be my basis. I\n         usually had to guess at the basslines, as they'd become totally\n         inaudible on the tape. Then I'd U-U the result back to Gerard within 2\n         hours, and if I was lucky I'd get £100 about 6 months later after the\n         'middle man' had taken his bit. Or half that if the tune was for\n         Ocean.' (BH)\n

I quite liked\n         it at the time, but more for the effects than the rather scrappy lead\n         lines.

I was coding\n         the music player and tried to create some drum sounds when I\n         accidentally got some harsh, very distorted sounds.

/MUSICIANS/T/Taylor_Stuart/Sky_Runner.sid	COMMENT: 'I had been commissioned by Orpheus Software (ironically the makers of\n         Electrosound) to code the music for their game Sky Runner. They sent\n         me a work-in-progress version of the game along with a\n         sort-of-completed Electrosound composition. They wanted me to\n         transpose this to a non-Electrosound version and make it my own - what\n         you hear on here is the end result. Unfortunately the MD of Orpheus at\n         the time was a complete nightmare to work with - I was young and naive\n         at the time but this was my first experience, commercially, of trying\n         to get money out of someone. He just wouldn't pay - kept saying cheque\n         would be in the post, give it another week or so etc etc....looking at\n         Sky Runner for the first time ever (on here) it looks like the\n         programmer's deal with Orpheus went pretty sour as well. I see the\n         game was published by another software house (Cascade?) and the music\n         had gone back to it's original Electrosound composition - obviously I\n         had no dealings with Cascade - they probably didn't even know about my\n         arrangement!!.... About 1 year later, under new management, Orpheus\n         approached me again asking me to do some more music. OK, I said,\n         firstly you pay me for Sky Runner and secondly I want the money for\n         the new music (I think it was an adaption of some board game involving\n         moving buses around London???) up front - they obliged so there was a\n         happy ending to this story.'

I could actually compose music in the\n         classical traditional sence :) It's all COMPOSED by me. More people\n         seemed to be wondering if I *really composed Bad Blood*. The answer is\n         yes with a capital Y.\n         Charles Deenen said it was the 'best music I made on C64' when I\n         finished it. (I do NOT agree ofcourse, although I must say it's the\n         best 'filmscore' soundtrack I've done for a game on the C64. I\n         actually got some kind of filmscript for it, that's why I could be\n         very specific when composing themes for characters and events in the\n         game.\n

/MUSICIANS/T/Tel_Jeroen/KOUD_HE.sid	COMMENT: This tune was the original prototype for the title theme from Savage.\n         Jeroen did this first, sampling the Dutch comedian Harry Vermeegen.\n         'Koud he' was his catchphrase and translated it means 'Cold eh?'.\n         His most notorious use of this was a Dutch TV programme called 'Pisa'\n         (filmed from the leaning tower) with Harry saying his 'Koud He?'\n         catchphrase to everyone that went by. Probe Software then heard the\n         tune and asked Jeroen if he'd change the samples, and lo and behold it\n         became the Savage theme.\n         'Some background info. The 'KOUD HE' sample is from a Dutch comedian\n         called 'Harry Vermeegen'. It was like a hype saying. I found it a nice\n         sample to play around with.

Tune #3 is an early version of what would eventually be\n         used in the game 'Dominion' bundled on a Zzap! 64 covertape in 1990,\n         and tune #4 is an early version of the 'Aggressor Theme'. The final\n         version of this (and the one which Revolution uses) is the one on MW's\n         'Zzap! 64 Music Demo' which appeared on Zzap 64's June 1989 covermount\n         cassette. (Comment by Warren Pilkington)\n(#4)\nCOMMENT: This tune was also used in a game called Revolution (written by Simon\n         Pick). The game was never released, but featured on Commodore Format\n         magazine's powerpack (tape) number one.\n

I'd tried to do\n         a version of it back in 2009, but didn't get beyond the first 30\n         seconds or so.  It was good to go back and start from scratch, and\n         concentrate first on getting the basslines right, and from there\n         build the tune up.  It also plays a little bit faster than the\n         original does to keep it faster paced too.

The disk was thought to be lost when I moved house many\n         years ago, but found an unlabelled disk, and saw the file names on\n         there.  When I loaded them into Ubik's Musik it was indeed this,\n         so pretty good to salvage it all round.\n         On the same disk as the Arsenal title tune, I'd put together a few\n         sound effects which could have played when you were playing the game\n         of football.

/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Action_Biker_Remix.sid	  TITLE: Action Biker, Tune #1\n ARTIST: Rob Hubbard\nCOMMENT: 'This is a remix from Rob Hubbard's Action Biker main theme (tune #1)\n         from the year 1985! (C) Mastertronic. Listen to the original and hear\n         the difference! I first typed over the notes (bass + lead) from a Music\n         Assembler example tune. Not using the ugly percussion track. The\n         chords are typed over from a Midi file called Biker. (Lazy me eh?!).\n         Maybe this will not be necessary in future because there is a Midi to\n         Mod program and buddy Roland Hermans has made a Mod to Sid program.\n         I'm not quite happy with this tune because of the weak 2 notes\n         arpeggio part (from 1:14 to 1:50). I made the volume of this arpeggio\n         part a bit softer so it becomes a bit less annoying. Maybe I will\n         improve this tune sometime. Same presets used as in Rolfie Title\n         Remix. Typing over the notes took some amount of time (I always work\n         slowly!). I used too many sequences in the 2nd track (it can only\n         handle 128). So Roland Hermans 'packed' several sequences into only a\n         few so the player can handle them. This is the 2nd tune for mainly\n         Polish based group Axelerate. Tune is played at CIA 1 Timer A (PAL)\n         because we wanted another speed than a normal one. Tune has nice\n         ending, don't you agree? Hope you like it!' (JW)\n

So some of other composer's music was the basis of\n         some tunes varied with own ideas and combinations of these 2. Of course\n         Roland Hermans (Neo) helped me with the technical bits.'

It's\n         simple to do and still sounds great. The combination with the Matrix\n         tune works well I think. Also I listened to a lot of hard rock/heavy\n         metal music to get inspired. A lot of what Matt Gray did can be\n         identified with this style. Using double bass plus MG drums is a good\n         combination plus after that a ring modulation lead sounds nice.' (JW)\n(#3)\n   NAME: Massive Attack\nCOMMENT: 'Massive Attack begins with 2 tracks shooting SFX from the game\n         Dominator. Then a Star Wars alike film tune. The piece after that the\n         Jon Dunn's Robocop lead instrument fits and sounds so well! Some funny\n         kicks and snares in different volumes.

(JW)\n(#4)\n   NAME: Arduous Battle\nCOMMENT: 'Arduous Battle is completely done by me. In a lot of places the bass\n         notes are harder on the beat. In this I made a 64 version of a tune I\n         composed on the Amiga with Protracker which was called Freedom.

The break in this part is my\n         friend Roland's favourite (You know him from the PSID64 program). And\n         the last part is composed by myself using some Galway  Rambo tune #5\n         instruments which I made a bit harder volume wise. Oh yes the\n         instrument of the arpeggios is an enhanced version of Jason Brooke's\n         Bismarck arp. preset.' (JW)\n(#7)\n   NAME: Space Explorer\nCOMMENT: 'Space Explorer has a very mysterious intro. As you can hear Philip\n         Glass is one of my favourite composers. Jam jam! Sounds very nice!

This tune consists of a\n         double lead to get a sort of echo effect. The reason why I made this\n         song: In the south of Holland we celibrate Carnival each year around\n         the end of February and because I live in a provence of Southern\n         Holland called Limburg I decided to make one of the best Carnival\n         songs on the C64! During Carnival everyone dresses up in some strange\n         costume and goes into pubs to party and of course drink a lot of beer.\n         The title of the song translated into English is: When the stars are\n         shining up there.

/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Beast_III_Title.sid	  TITLE: press fire [from the Amiga game Shadow of the Beast III]\n ARTIST: Tim Wright\nCOMMENT: 'Of course I had to squeeze the Amiga 4 tracks in to C64's 3. But the\n         tune uses 2 tracks for the part which isn't the lead or bass. How do\n         you call that part anyway? (backing?) While going through old Amiga\n         500 games with buddy Roland (we were looking through because we are\n         planning a C64 demo consisting converted Amiga pics in FLI-Interlace)\n         we stumbled upon this tune. I like it very much so I tried if I could\n         rip it with my Datel Electronics' Amiga Action Replay MK III. I froze\n         the game and typed in tracker. And golly yes! The cartridge found the\n         tune and I saved it to disc and loaded it in my Protracker soundtool.\n         Together with Roland I converted it. (He works much quicker than me).\n         We are planning to do more conversions. After this conversion Roland\n         made a program to convert from MOD to SID, right into my player as\n         I said in Action Biker Remix STIL text. But now it even converts\n         arpeggios! The presets are: bass from Psycho Pigs UXB. Flute resembles\n         Amiga lead sample instrument but has a little waveform 41 tick at\n         the beginning and is made by Roland. Other preset is from Henning\n         Rokling's Henning_Rokling-02.sid which is used in demo Wild At Heart.\n         We first made an arpeggio sound consisting of two different c notes\n         but it didn't work out well. In beginning of the tune you can hear a\n         build up of decay and sustain in this preset. To get this effect we\n         had to make 4 presets just changing the decay and sustain from 2 to 8.\n         The wave on effects on bass and Rokling preset make it sound ok on\n         C64. Often this effect is used to substitute normal hi hat sounds.\n         This ditty is one of my favourite tunes!' (JW)\n

The idea to\n         make this mini tune was that I coincidentally found a nice midi file\n         on the net from which I only used the background. Preset of this is\n         taken from Demon's Aural Manouvers II.

/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Lullaby.sid	COMMENT: 'Called sleeping song because Roland thought it was a song from which\n         you get very sleepy. The chords are taken from the beginning of the\n         music of a Dutch USA team demo called Nemesis, I made use of some\n         sawtooth presets to get that Galway feel. Bassline is simply using a C\n         note and the C note an octave higher. Made in Music Assembler which\n         was shortened by pally Roland Hermans, so it only occupies memory from\n         $1000-$12EF on the C64 which is 3 blocks (less than 1 K!). Neil\n         Baldwin's Demonic-Part_1 was an example for me, using 2 tracks for\n         lead when the bass is suspended.

The cd rom is called\n         'Rolfie Op Wereldreis' which is translated: 'Rolfie On A World Trip'\n         and is about a cat which travels around the world visiting 10\n         countries from which England and America are divided into 2 pages. So\n         in total there are 12 different country drawings, a title page, a\n         credits page and and end page. With every page there comes an\n         appropriate, spheric music plus lyrics about what can be seen in the\n         drawings. All the sight seeing objects can be seen in a picture of\n         each country. For instance in Egypt you can see: some pyramids, a\n         sphinx, the Nile, a palm tree, some background items and Rolfie the\n         cat on a camel. When you click on an object it starts to animate and a\n         WAV-file begins to play making e.g. a camel sound and telling a story\n         about e.g. a camel. This title tune is apart from the melody altered\n         heavily to let it sound ok on the C64. This is the first tune I made\n         since 1992 which was spread, so you can call it a sort of test tune.\n         And this is also the first tune made for mainly Poland based group\n         Axelerate which has died in the beginning of 2001. All presets are the\n         same as in Linko music except before every bass sound (from 0:15),\n         there is a kick drum sound added. Idea for 3 track chords in beginning\n         is from Reyn Ouwehand's Deadlock (brilliant title tune).

I made an extra-routine for\n         each sound. From music to music I changed that routine to get\n         different sounds. I have made some musics, good and bad sounds.

The result was a bearable compromise. The screen\n         glitches were almost gone and the music still sounds fairly good.'\n         (From an interview with Pasi Hytönen, the programmer of the game, in\n         MikroBITTI 4/87)\n
