SONGLENGTH DATABASE
===================

Since HVSC#68 there are several ways to read the song lengths info of
a SID, via:

- Song length database (old format)
- Song length database (new format)
- SSL files for players that run on C64 hardware

With HVSC both the old and new format of the song length database are
included. One with hashes with a specific MD5 calculation and one with
MD5 hashes based on the full content. The latter is the new way and is
the easiest to implement.

SSL files are needed when you want song length info for sidplayers
that run on a C64. A script is provided with HVSC which extracts the
song length info and generates SSL files. See "SSL FILE FORMAT"
section for more info.

The song length for each SID and sub tune can be found in:

C64Music\DOCUMENTS\Songlengths.txt
C64Music\DOCUMENTS\Songlengths.md5

Each SID has a unique MD5 hash that SID players can use to get the
song lengths of a SID.

For every HVSC release a new Songlengths database is provided with
updated and added hashes. Therefore, always ensure with each HVSC update
that the latest Songlengths database is used.

The song length of a SID is based on the PAL / NTSC emulation that the
SID is made for. If you decide to play the SID on a different
frequency than intended then the song length will not be correct.


THE NEW FORMAT
==============

The new format of the song length is used in file:

C64Music\DOCUMENTS\Songlengths.md5

The file format is INI-style. The first line of the file is always:

[Database]

Commented lines start with a semi colon.

Hashes are MD5 fingerprints (a 32 character string in HEX) and can be
calculated based on the full content of the SID file (including the
SID header).

An example of a song length line:

c4c5ff8cfefdf683c50e66775cfac1ee=3:57 1:02 0:06 0:02 0:01 0:01 0:02 0:04 0:03 0:02 0:03

The line has the format:

key=value

Where key is the MD5 hash and the value includes the song lengths
which are separated with a space.

Each song length is of format:

mm:ss

where mm and ss are numbers and mm never starts with a 0. The minimum
length of a SID tune is 1 second.

Above every song length line, a comment is placed which includes the
file path of the SID within HVSC.


THE OLD FORMAT
==============

Most SID players will use the old format. For now, both song lengths
databases are included in HVSC. Once sidplayers adopt the new format,
only the new format will be included in future releases of HVSC.
To make sure that you can always use old players and tools, we will
provide a script so you can always generate the old song length file
in the old format for the latest HVSC release.

The old format has the same file structure as the new format, but
differs in:

- MD5 hash based on different reading of the content of the file
- optional attributes (G, M, Z, B) after the song length

The meaning of the attributes:
  (G) = all three SID voices have had GATE off
  (M) = master volume turned zero
  (Z) = all three SID voices have been silent
  (B) = sidtune does bad things in memory / timestamp estimated

An example:

a08c08aa1c74990c7d753e8c1d2f023e=3:57 1:02 0:06(G) 0:02(G) 0:01(G) 0:01(G) 0:02(G) 0:04(G) 0:03(G) 0:02(G) 0:03(G)

The calculation of the MD5 fingerprint is as follows:

- Read all data starting from the data offset
- Read init address (lo-byte first)
- Read play address (lo-byte first)
- Read number of songs (lo-byte first)
- For each speed flag bit, calculate if the speed is CIA or VBI speed.
  Then perform the following for all 32 bits:
  - read 0 for VBI speed
  - read 60 for CIA speed
- When the SID is NTSC specific, read 2

SSL FILE FORMAT
===============

SSL stands for SID Song Length. Since on a C64 the song lengths
database is too big, we have defined a new file format so that
players can read the song length info in an easy way on specific
hardware where all HVSC files can be stored.

You can use the following script to generate the files and folders:

http://hvsc.de/download/files/tools/Generate_SSL_Files.zip

This script will generate SSL files for each SID. The SSL files will
be put in the SONGLENGTHS folders.

To generate the files and folders, call the script like this:

python Generate_SSL_Files.py <HVSC-PATH>

To remove the files and folders, call the script like this:

python Generate_SSL_Files.py -d <HVSC-PATH>

Note that for every HVSC update, the SSL files and SONGLENGTHS folders
need to be thrown away using the -d option of the tool before updating
HVSC. After the update the script can be run again to create the
folders with the SSL files.

File format and HVSC structure:

- Each folder in HVSC that includes one or more SID files will get
  another folder called SONGLENGTHS (in uppercase).
- The SONGLENGTHS folder gets all the filenames of the parent folder
  but instead of the "sid" extension it will get the extension "ssl".
- SSL files are binary files where the song length of each sub tune is
  defined in BCD format (2 bytes per sub tune), minutes first then
  seconds.
- Maximum sub tunes in a SID is 256 and therefore the maximum length
  of the SSL file is 512 bytes.
- The SONGLENGTHS folders may be hidden on the file system (up to the
  user to decide).

An example:

We have the following in Songlengths.md5 defined:

; /MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid
c4c5ff8cfefdf683c50e66775cfac1ee=3:57 1:02 0:06 0:02 0:01 0:01 0:02 0:04 0:03 0:02 0:03

The Commando.ssl file will look like this in HEX:
03 57 01 02 00 06 00 02 00 01 00 01 00 02 00 04 00 03 00 02 00 03

The file structure will look like this for files Chimera and Commando:

SONGLENGTHS
    Chimera.ssl
    Commando.ssl
Chimera.sid
Commando.sid

When a sidplayer reads e.g. Commando.sid, it should check if the
SONGLENGTHS folder exists and then read the Commando.ssl file
to read the song length info.
