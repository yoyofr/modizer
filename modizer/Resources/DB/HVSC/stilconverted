/DEMOS/0-9/128_Byte_Blues_BASIC.sid	COMMENT: 'When I first had a look at the 512b/1k Tiny SID compo, I thought it'd\n         be a great way to get back into doing some assembly language on the\n         C=64 (which I haven't done for a long time). I spent a fair amount of\n         time thinking of the best way to reduce the size and decided that one\n         of the best ways would be to really challenge myself and to squeeze\n         some music out of 128 bytes just for fun.\n         I really wanted to feature the nature of the C=64, so I thought about\n         several ways to best store the note and instrument data. After a few\n         sketches, I found that I seemed to be wasting a lot of space trying to\n         store both the note and duration data, so I decided that the best way\n         would be to derive the notes and durations directly from the C=64\n         memory and just index into a basic blues scale and generate some\n         music. It took a bit of playing around with techniques, but I found\n         that utilizing individual bits to step up or down within the scale\n         generated the most musical results. Somewhat of a 1-bit DPCM technique\n         except for successive music notes in a scale instead of successive\n         samples. So, the code basically cycles through the bits which are\n         displayed in the screen memory and uses them to generate the notes.\n         The note duration is set by combining the jiffy clock and the cursor\n         countdown to give some flex to the tempo. I found that staying in one\n         note sequence was boring, so I made it step through two blues scales.\n         I tried to squeeze out more space by removing the low byte of the\n         frequency but found that it either made the music too out of tune or\n         too high in pitch. I also attempted to add a second voice, but ran out\n         of space. I really liked the idea of adding something to watch while\n         it's playing, so the colours change as it is reading through the bytes\n         of screen memory. Rolling the bits of screen memory had the additional\n         benefit that the bytes would return to their original form after\n         passing over them eight times when the sequence repeats. Since the\n         tempo is partially derived from the cursor blink, it is possible to\n         change the tempo while moving the cursor. The sequence of notes can\n         also be modified by typing in the upper portion of the screen.\n         It should sound fine on any C=64 (NTSC/PAL), SID (6581/8580) or good\n         emulator (VICE, PowerPC etc..). I've had great fun working on this\n         piece and hope others have fun listening and playing around with it as\n         well.' (Freaky DNA)\n

The\n         first music disk was completely broken when it arrived, so I recovered\n         all that I could (almost) hear and composed the full tunes from the\n         beginning. When I got the second disk, I realised that the tunes I\n         modified, were not composed for the game parts I used them in.\n         Moreover, they told me that my compositions were a lot better than\n         his!!! Only the final track, the one that plays during the end titles\n         (tune #6), remained untouched. Furthermore, I didn't write about this\n         on the title screen, since actually the basic sound was created by\n         Michael anyway.'

This demo contained a new version\n         of the tune (this SID). He explains how he had made the music two\n         years earlier on some composer like Soundmonitor or something similar.\n         While at a copyparty, someone supposedly stole his music disk which\n         had the tune on it. This was his only copy of the tune. About two\n         months later, the tune appeared on a Papillions' intro and no credit\n         was given to van Santen.

Then I programmed the codeblocks myself to get the\n         Lambada tune right. I laughed when 20CC found out that their player\n         was used and Falco Paul or Edwin van Santen hadn't made that tune\n         earlier!!! They accused me of ripping routines etc. etc. Well.. they\n         were right, I never claimed that it was my player but I merged my\n         Lambada tune blocks via assembler into their old music blocks (I\n         overwrote it). The funniest thing was that the Lambada tune from me\n         was very populair at that time. When 20CC heard it they made their own\n         Lambada tune, hehehehe...' (Patrick Peters)\n

This tune was entered at the Forever\n         10 party, and made it to an average 6th place, although I think the\n         tune deserved probably a lower position, because of the amount of\n         great tunes there was at that event.

This tune was released at the\n         Primary Star party of 2006 and it made 3rd place, which I was quite\n         happy with.

I was\n         dead impressed with the quality of this nice piece of music. This song\n         was originally entered for the X-2008 music compo, but I was\n         unfortunate to not have been able to enter this tune into the compo,\n         as the organizers disallowed email music submissions this time round.\n         Probably because of the amount of music entries they received. They\n         did enter my demo, Crazy Fish into the compo. The music later got used\n         as the tape loading music for the Mayhem in Monsterland music mix.\n         Glad I found some use for this nice piece of music. I feel that this\n         tune is probably one of my best efforts so far,' (RB)\n

I had three weeks to\n         produce the music and sound effects for the C64, Spectrum, and\n         Amstrad versions, which included time to write a music driver for the\n         C64. It was a good learning experience but I wish I had more time to\n         work on the tunes as most of my efforts went into writing the software.\n         I remember listening to the music form The Last Ninja and Wizball at\n         that time, trying to figure out how they created the sounds so I could\n         write my music driver. Martin Galway later told me how he created the\n         high pitched wooden block 'pop' sound, which was achieved by running\n         the driver at 240Hz.' (GB)\n

/MUSICIANS/B/Bjerregaard_Johannes/Thunderforce.sid	COMMENT: 'I wrote most of Thunderforce together with my highschool friend Peter\n         Uhd Jespsen. The game was originally written for the Danish company\n         called Keleline. Peter was a big fan of Depeche Mode and had most of\n         their records. Therefore we wanted to get some tunes from DM in the\n         game. Keleline wrote to DM and first got a yes, but then the group\n         decided no. At least that was the story we were told, but I think,\n         that the director of the company cheated us. Somewhere out there is a\n         small demo, which have the five tunes in it.'\n         (Info from Eric Christensen).

/MUSICIANS/B/Blues_Muz/Gallefoss_Glenn/Ode_to_Bugg.sid	  TITLE: Mystified [from the Amiga MOD module]\n ARTIST: Jogeir Liljedahl\nCOMMENT: Prior to public release, GRG believed this tune was originally done on\n         the Amiga by Liljedahl. According to GRG, when fellow countryman Geir\n         Tjelta heard the SID, Tjelta informed GRG that he thought the original\n         was actually done by Bug (Stein Erik Giske) rather than Liljedahl.\n         Tjelta also informed GRG that Bug passed away in 1992 thus giving GRG\n         inspiration to rename the tune before releasing publicly. Unfortunately\n         Tjelta's credit information was incorrect, however Tjelta does not\n         recall giving GRG incorrect credits perhaps suggesting there was a\n         miscommunication between the two. Another theory is that there may\n         have been confusion between Jogeir's 'Mystified' and one of Bug's\n         tunes named 'Slider' where the first few notes are similar but indeed\n         the two tunes are very different. Reflecting back, Jogeir Liljedahl, a\n         friend and group member of the late Bug, adds the following: 'When it\n         comes to Mystified, it's 100% my original tune. I haven't even thought\n         about the similarities to Bug's Slider tune, but the 5-6 first notes\n         of the song are similar to Mystified. But it's a completely different\n         song of course. Either me or Bug noticed that back then, and Bug was\n         a huge fan of Mystified, since he was among the first to hear the song\n         (along with Olav Rasmus Vorren aka Shorty).'\n

/MUSICIANS/B/Blues_Muz/Nordboe_Kjell/Last_Flight.sid	COMMENT: ''Last Flight' is the song about a person which is taking drugs. It\n         is a sad story for both the family to the user, and the user itself,\n         which later in the song dies, it's the user's last flight. The family\n         which stands back with their dead son or daughter is so unhappy and\n         sad that they don't know anything anymore. They're feeling a huge\n         emptyness inside, they only wish their child back again, staying\n         alive. But that will never happen... The last few minutes when the\n         child was alive, it dreamed about a sky of marvelous and wonderful\n         things flying all around. The longer it lasted the longer away this\n         person was to all real things we know here on earth. This child, so\n         young, has left the world. Not alive anymore. Doesn't exist, only the\n         body left for the family to bury and their memories to keep. Why do\n         some want to legalize it?' (KN)\n

It is a mix of\n         originally someone's else work. The (C) sign there is merely just an\n         indication of what groups released, or used this tune.

/MUSICIANS/B/Brennan_Neil/	COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Brennan to be his.\n         The HVSC team via their sources have checked all the original credits\n         and found that most of the tunes that were supposedly done by Greg\n         Holland were in fact made by Neil Brennan. For most of the games Greg\n         Holland was the graphic artist rather than the composer. The HVSC Crew\n         also has confirmation of this fact from a senior employee of Beam\n         Software, who was on Melbourne House's main programming team at the\n         time. Brennan's own comments are denoted (NB).\n         'The only musician I knew at Melbourne House pre-me (I think I started\n         in 1983) was Adrian Pertout. A guy named Gavin Anderson (I think) came\n         after me, but I lost contact with that company fairly quickly, so I'm\n         a pretty poor source of information.' (NB)\n

This is a kind of jazz\n         tune, it's not my style ya know, but I felt like doing a tune like\n         this because lots a people like it. Therefore I added sum of my music\n         style to the tune, that's why it sounds a bit techno like.. Try to\n         enjoy this tune with a stereo, you'll like it I guess.. By the way\n         remember that all C128 computers have a different filter set on their\n         SID chips,so the music sounds a bit different than on normal C64\n         computers, you'll hear the difference on the bass, the filters doesn't\n         open theirselves so much on C128! But who the fuck cares, this music\n         runs on all computers, that's what counts! [...]'\n         (Taken from a note added to the tune 'Positive' by Chotaire himself)\n

The task was to make the Oric Atmos computer I had\n         at home play the theme tune to Airwolf. Over the weekend I managed to\n         get the tune playing using a very simple assembler that I had written\n         in basic. As a result I got the job at Elite and the first thing they\n         had me doing was programming the Airwolf tune on the C64 as they were\n         doing a game based on the TV show. After this I found myself doing\n         music all the time and that is how I got started.' (MC)\n

The middle section\n         of my version may be original though, the tune plays a little faster\n         than on the arcade machine. This was due to the fact that my routine\n         didn't contain a fractional timer at that point.

While the\n         music and sfx was done in 1990, the game was put on ice by the\n         Austrian guys as they became tired of it. Some years later they\n         revived the project, finished it, and sold it to a German software\n         house under the new name, 'Hermetic''.

/MUSICIANS/D/Danko_Tomas/Shock_Magazine.sid	  TITLE: Rubicon, Tune #1\n ARTIST: Jeroen Tel\nCOMMENT: 'They wanted a title-theme for Shock Magazine, and gave me the first\n         issue. There was a song in there, and I had no clue what it really\n         was but thought it captured the feel of the entire magazine. So I\n         simply made a cover of it, Danko style. I never had any hangups about\n         having to do it all, music is all about sharing and developing ideas\n         together in order to reach higher grounds. The chords aren't\n         identical to Jeroen's version, in fact we had a little thing over\n         that at a party in Oslo back in '94 or so. We hung over a keyboard\n         and I played the chords my style, and he went like 'No! It's like\n         THIS!' and I said 'Well, I want it THIS way!'. *grin* One of the guys\n         at the party leaned over to me and whispered that he in fact\n         preferred my version of the track. *smirk* Jeroen superimposed a sus2\n         chord throughout the progression until it folds back to the tonic,\n         where the sus2 becomes a m7. It's a nice move, one that I personally\n         use quite a lot myself. But this time around I expanded the\n         progression to plain chords following the bassline.\n         After I had done the tune I found out that it was from Rubicon, but\n         to me it doesn't matter.\n         Later on I made a remix of it, called it Schizomix, with weird\n         sounds. Because Rubicon had been a double-speed song, or something\n         similar, I wanted to make weird and similar sounds but in a single-\n         speed player. And that's all it was, a messed up version of my first\n         cover so to speak.' (TD)\n

I later found out he had terminal cancer.\n         This crushed me to no end. At work I started playing these harmonies\n         on a keyboard (I owned a music store at the time) and it evolved\n         into a song.\n         I wanted him to hear the track to support him in his struggle. Memory\n         eludes me but I do believe he got the word I was making a SID for him\n         and he liked that.\n         He never got to hear the final version. I was completely crushed over\n         this for quite some time.\n         Emulation won't give this track a fair chance, I'm kicking the shit\n         out of old school analog synthesis knowledge and using very slow\n         filter and ringmodulation etc to slowly move through harmonics\n         matching the octaves in sync with the patterns so that the song opens\n         up slowly. This is lost in translation on any emulator.' (TD)\n

/MUSICIANS/D/Detert_Thomas/Gordian_Tomb.sid	COMMENT: 'After we got the contract [for Gordian Tomb] with a good value of\n         money, we discussed how to divide it to the people. This was a mess.\n         We at least lost some days of programming. Michael [Detert] was\n         menacing with a dropout if Thomas didn't compose the music. So I\n         thought ok, we are a team and I am busy with programming - why not?\n         But then we couldn't unite about the amount of money. Thomas should\n         get the twice of a normal level for a salary. If I had been a better\n         businessman these days I had done everything by myself, but at least\n         we had a great time and a lot of fun. And the teamwork was always\n         accurate. Finally Thomas had known that the salary was overdrawn and\n         he repaid every dollar with the longest music ever [32:06 minutes] on\n         commodore 64.' (Info from Markus Schneider).\n(#1)\nCOMMENT: The original release has a protection which overlaps a fraction of\n         the music data, causing dirty sounds in this tune (most notably, the\n         bass). The game was also released without protection and with correct\n         data, which is present in this rip.\n

/MUSICIANS/D/Dunn_David/Flight_Path_737.sid	COMMENT: 'Anil [Gupta] asked me to go and meet Roger Gamon. His son had a\n         program called Flight, and they wanted some intro music for it. Anil\n         said to take along some samples.\n         When I arrived, their front room was cluttered with hardware and C64\n         samplers. I remember saying that I could do with one of those. I took\n         along two sample pieces. One was something in the vein of Those\n         Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines, which they were really\n         unimpressed with, but the second one rather bowled them over. It was a\n         tune I'd originally written in 1975; I'd found that using the ADSR on\n         a saw channel gave the bass riff an echoey effect, and two pulses\n         slightly detuned from each other played the main theme. I was hired!\n         But I still never got that sampler...' (JD)\n
/MUSICIANS/D/Dunn_David/Fourth_Protocol.sid	COMMENT: 'The Fourth Protocol was based on a carol I wrote for my school choir,\n         which they performed at Capital Radio in 1979. It was a great theme,\n         but alternated between 4/4 and 3/4 time, which was a huge headache\n         when it came to adapting it for the three-channel C64. It is, however,\n         one of those themes you just have to go back and orchestrate.\n         Fortunately, I still have the original Capital tapes.' (JD)\n

/MUSICIANS/D/Dunn_David/Pipes.sid	COMMENT: 'I was in a computer shop in Dartford, Kent and I said to someone:\n         'BASIC is so slow, is there anything that goes faster?' Suddenly, Anil\n         Gupta pops up out of nowhere, literally, and says: 'You need this',\n         handing me what turned out to be a compiler program. I then mentioned\n         that I wrote music, and his eyes started to shine. He asked me to come\n         back once I'd done something in machine code, which I did. It was a\n         demo program made up of some really naff graphics in BASIC, combined\n         with some machined-coded versions of The Mexican Hat Dance, The Thames\n         TV Logo trail and Pipes of Peace.

I re-wrote the whole loader/driver program to make it\n         work. The tune was easy, it had been buzzing around in my head for\n         ages. Thai Boxing was probably the beginning of the end for me: Roger\n         Gamon had since died of a brain tumour, Ocean had enlisted their own\n         in-house programmer, and as the sole contracted person there, I felt I\n         was becoming disinterested.'

/MUSICIANS/F/Feil_Georg/Synth_Sample.sid	COMMENT: 'I wrote it around '84 or '85 as a demo for my music editor called\n         'Synth'. I was going to University of Waterloo at the time and just\n         gave it to a friend of mine... didn't even bother to put my name on\n         the thing. Anyway it soon started cropping up all over the place.\n         I never made any sequels with music, although there was something with\n         annoying sound effects done in the same style as Synth Sample that I\n         posted in the beginning of 1994. So any music you see that looks like\n         a sequel or has graphics added was done by someone else.\n         Anyway the computer bust of 85/86(?) hit and Synth was never marketed.\n         I had been negotiating with a software company but they went out of\n         business. By that time I was working on a new version of Synth that\n         was a sequencer program for Midi instruments (called MSS), and had\n         joined my first band. I've been in a couple other bands since then,\n         the last one was called SugarPush and we came close to getting signed\n         (but then broke up [...]). So I guess you can credit that little\n         program with launching my musical career...'

[...] It appears on\n         Synth Sample as interpreted by a friend of mine. I didn't know what it\n         was myself until I happened to see Stationary Ark one time.

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Arkanoid.sid	COMMENT: This is the very first published tune on the C64 that used samples.\n         'Q: How did you get involved with using sampled sounds?\n         MG: I figured out how samples were played by hacking into someone\n         else's code... OK, I admit it... It was a drum synthesizer package\n         called Digidrums, actually, so you could still say I was the first to\n         include samples in a piece of music. [...] Never would I claim to have\n         invented that technique, I just got it published first. In fact, I\n         couldn't really figure out where they got the sample data, just that\n         they were wiggling the volume register, so I tried to make up my own\n         drum sample sounds in realtime - which is the flatulence stuff that\n         shipped in 'Arkanoid'. [...] After the project was in the shops I\n         gained access to some real drum samples, and I slid those into my own\n         custom version of the tune. The one that's in the shops is kind of a\n         collage of farts & burps, don't you think?

I had been handed 'Miami\n         Vice' and 'Highlander' because the outside development team working on\n         it hadn't worked out who was going to do the sound (notice those games\n         have little or no sound-effects), so I did my best in a very short\n         time. I [...] picked 'The Chase' and the 'Main Theme' as the two tunes\n         I would do. We had settled on two modes for the game - in your car and\n         out of it I think. (Or maybe it was in the game and out of it, I can't\n         remember.) I started on 'The Chase' and if you listen to the first few\n         seconds of that you can hear the basis of that super-filter-echo tune\n         that is so cool. I recall David Collier was sitting in the office with\n         me while I was working on it. But while messing with it while everyone\n         else was at lunch, I came across this cool sound. I added to it and\n         added to it, and when we applied the non-sync'd filter sweep we both\n         flipped out! I decided to abandon the conversion of that tune and\n         simply go with the cool sounds I had stumbled upon. When the guys came\n         back from lunch and listened to it they swore that there was a\n         cassette deck connected somewhere and it wasn't the C64 playing it!\n         Such a sound had not been heard before by any of us out of the C64. So\n         I extended it and turned it into this tripping-out 11-minute piece.\n         The main theme itself... I simply did my best with no drums (Rob\n         Hubbard's strength). I think my strength with guitar solos helped pull\n         it off. Both of those problematic games benefited from my music,\n         actually, and the Ocean management were very relieved\n         (understatement).'

He realized it only after he played the album\n         again after the game was already shipped.\n         '[Parallax] was 11 minutes long, certainly my longest at the time. I\n         took my development gear home to work on it for a week or two. I just\n         said to myself 'OK, it's going to be this mega-tune, so the intro has\n         to be mega'. The intro took up two-thirds of the tune! I actually got\n         bored with it, and stuck that silly melody on the end which doesn't\n         really match. Going back I would have made it less melodic.

So I developed a\n         'filter adjustment' parameter for my music program which would allow\n         the customer to control this filter unreliability and get their\n         particular machine to sound cool. But David Collier never put it in\n         the options screen. (DOH!) There's always something wrong, eh?'

(MG)\n(#1)\nCOMMENT: 'The most complex original tune I did was the 'Times Of Lore' title\n         tune, it took 20 days just to do the guitar solos! It has a random\n         number generator which selects different guitar solos, but I didn't\n         realise that people wouldn't leave it looping for its 11-minute\n         duration so the work all got sort of wasted.'

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Wizball.sid	(#2)\nCOMMENT: The opening bars of this tune are sampled by the group Console on\n         their song '14 Zero Zero'.\n(#4)\nCOMMENT: 'I was working at the Sensible Software office at the time of the\n         major music creation, but the title screen music never got finished.\n         When I returned to Ocean I got on with some other things, all the time\n         worrying about this unfinished tune. Finally I slapped something on\n         the end of it. I knew I could never top the first part, that's what\n         the problem was. In my mind the second part of the tune is pretty lame\n         compared with the first part. But for some people it represents the\n         mysterious, magical, unconventional aspect of 'Wizball' so it fits in\n         some ways. But you can tell it's not really like the other music in\n         the game, which was primarily developed when I was with the Sensi\n         boys, basking in that Sensi VIBE.'

So I plugged in this echoing waveform thing and let it\n         rip. The tune isn't particularly Chinese sounding, but I was working\n         on producing that 'perfect melody', the one you'd be humming all day,\n         you know. That was a phase I went through. [...] The sound I was\n         converting from was itself a conversion of the arcade cabinet, which I\n         have NEVER SEEN. It sounded like it was a lame conversion too, so I\n         easily did a better sounding version. (The MSX's music only used two\n         notes at once, for example.)'

It\n         was time for a change, and by then I was starting to release dance\n         music for club play. It's an alright piece of work, though I think the\n         sounds were probably better than some of the tunes. I've just reworked\n         it for a Kickstarter project and it sounds so much better now.'

It was\n         exactly the sort of thing I had been waiting to get my teeth into\n         musically. It took four weeks to complete, including an almost\n         two-week pause in the middle when the Great Storm of 1987 struck the\n         UK, leaving us without electricity or heating for about ten or eleven\n         days. I can remember walking down our road one dark evening, wondering\n         if I would ever get to use the C64 again, and suddenly noticing all the\n         neighbours' lights were finally on again. I went straight in, fired up\n         the assembler and carried on composing.'

I kind of figured I wouldn't be doing\n         the music on his next game, because he was developing his own music\n         routine. This was a smooth production, though, and I was pleased with\n         the results.' (MDG)\n

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Last_Ninja_2.sid	COMMENT: 'In 1988, as mentioned, I did The Last Ninja 2 for System 3. I did the\n         Central Park tracks first, which was important in order to stamp some\n         sort of 'sound' on the game. It basically took from mid-January until\n         early April to finish. It's about as big a project as you would want to\n         undertake, but everything just seemed to work without any real hitches.\n         I was given a fairly free hand to produce what I thought would be most\n         suitable and luckily, every time I took in new tracks for each level, I\n         got the thumbs up. It was a great time for me personally, to suddenly\n         be working full time on C64 music. I was almost 18, but I had no real\n         worries in the world beyond whether I could afford to buy a better car.\n         I think the entire The Last Ninja 2 soundtrack is my proudest\n         achievement, especially the Central Park tracks, as they seem to mean\n         so much to so many people. The project itself was a pleasure to be part\n         of. The whole team involved were probably at the top of their C64 game\n         at the time, from John's programming to Hugh's fantastic graphics,\n         Tim's storyboarding and of course Mark's overall vision and commitment.\n         It's amazing that we're still talking about it nearly 30 years on.'\n         (MDG)\n(#1)\n   NAME: Central Park (loader)\n(#2)\n   NAME: Central Park (in-game)\n(#3)\n   NAME: The Street (loader)\n(#4)\n   NAME: The Street (in-game)\n(#5)\n   NAME: The Sewers (loader)\n(#6)\n   NAME: The Sewers (in-game)\n  TITLE: Kentilla (3:31-6:08)\n ARTIST: Rob Hubbard\nCOMMENT: Only the part from 6:10-8:36 in Kentilla is covered here, mostly the\n         bassline of it.

The in-game tunes\n         needed to be written in such a way that if a sound effect played,\n         it didn't destroy the music too much. Stavros Fasoulas and Paul Cooper\n         drove up to my parents' house where I basically had the top floor of\n         a bungalow to myself. Stavros loaded up his game demos and went\n         through what was needed. I think it took me about two weeks to do all\n         the tunes and FX.

The drums and rhythms were also very\n         important in this game. There needed to be a tribal sound overall, and\n         I think I managed that.

/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/	COMMENT: All comments by Antti Hannula are denoted (AH).\n         'I practiced a lot making SIDs in the late 1980s but released my\n         first tunes in 1990. After Antti Kangas (Scorpion) finished\n         his first music routine for Artline Designs (ALD) we started to\n         release 'quality-sounds'. Before ALD I was the founder member of\n         Contex. All tunes were composed with an assembler.' (AH)\n
/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/ATA.sid	COMMENT: 'Released in 1992, made with ALD-player v3.0 which was developed late\n         1990. The routine turned out to be the one I used most, though v3.7\n         was even ready at the time.\n         The tune itself was the first one I was asked to do for a game. ATA\n         was a Tetris-clone done by German Lower Level and I don't recall if I\n         got paid for the track, but anyway it was liked by the authors and\n         apparently many others.\n         This must have been the best track I've done if I don't take count on\n         my new tunes. I wasn't anymore much into composing that time, I just\n         composed as a time-killer. Also a high score track was included.' (AH)\n

V2.1 didn't have any pulse data for $41 sounds so therefore\n         I just used $11 or $21 to have acceptable melody-sounds.\n         I was just playing around with the routine and somehow the Zone-theme\n         appeared into my mind, but it's only influenced by the theme and the\n         rest of the tune was just an effort of imagination.\n         Done in January/February 1990.'

/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/B-Ball.sid	COMMENT: 'The B-Ball sounds were ordered in the Autumn 92 just after I had\n         released my second music-collection which apparently didn't get spread\n         much as I sent it to my old pals, which I even didn't know if they\n         were in the scene anymore or not. The B-Ball track however, never got\n         released as the game wasn't sold (I guess). I liked this track a lot\n         myself and in fact it was the first time I had to do jingles. The\n         player I used was v3.6. B-Ball was the last (finished) track I did\n         until now in 1999.'

/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/Beyond_Grave.sid	COMMENT: 'Done in April 1999, yes! The first C64 tune after 1992. This tune\n         participated in Proxy 99 party in Finland, even though I wasn't\n         present it won the C64 music competition. Some people were really\n         amazed to see a track from me for a long long time. I made the basis\n         for it with Fasttracker and this is the way I compose the tunes these\n         days. It's not a hard job to 'convert' the into assembler if you just\n         make the tunes in a 64-style.' (AH)\n
/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/Compact.sid	COMMENT: 'Yet another one done in April 1999.

Later on I discovered that the arpeggios\n         turned out to be much like in Hawkeye by Jeroen Tel. I intended to do\n         a slow tune and this is what came out of my head.' (AH)\n

/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Thrust.sid	COMMENT: Review copies of this game had a bugged loader which mucked up the\n         music and so reviewers of the game gave the music a much lower rating.\n         Julian Rignall (ex-editor of Zzap! 64) takes up the story:\n         'I remember the God awful cacophony that was our review copy of\n         Thrust's music as though it were still playing. This was the problem:\n         the drum sounds worked, but all the other instrument sounds were\n         screwed - basically it resulted in this horrible screeching noise\n         playing to drums, rather than the cool heavyish sound that was heard\n         in the final version of the game. It sounded really harsh and so it\n         was duly shot down by us in the review. I remember hearing the\n         'proper' version of the game at a later dater and thinking 'ooooops!'.\n         After all it was a classic tune (it became one of my faves, indeed)\n         and we'd mercilessly beaten it down in the review, which was totally\n         unfair. Still, it was good to be able to do a ZZAPback on it and\n         remedy the error.'\n

/MUSICIANS/H/Huelsbeck_Chris/R-Type.sid	COMMENT: Very interesting story here. Katakis was released in September 1988 by\n         Rainbow Arts, however it never got a release in the UK as Activision\n         had it cancelled because of similarities to R-Type, to which\n         Activision had bought the conversion rights. Activision were getting\n         nowhere with their conversion of R-Type and they liked what they saw\n         of Katakis, so they hired the same programming team (Manfred Trenz and\n         others) to do the C64 conversion. They only got 6 weeks to write the\n         conversion, and sadly, it shows. Katakis was eventually altered and\n         released as Denaris in 1989.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Double_speed.sid	COMMENT: This is the only quickspeed tune not made in v17.Q0. It was made in\n         1989, some time before Jeroen Tel made his first quatro-tune for\n         'Invest'. However, the idea was not new at that time. In the\n         mid-eighties Tony Crowther experimented with quatro players in games\n         such as 'Zig Zag'. My double speed tune, however, used the ordinary v9\n         player and was simply called twice a frame.\n         Composed in JCH player v9.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Duchesse.sid	COMMENT: Composed in JCH player v13, tune length is 2:18.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Easy_does_it.sid	COMMENT: Notice how I put real synthesizer chords into the digi voice. That was\n         not done very often on the Commodore 64 - musicians normally used this\n         channel for bass and drums only. The tune makes extensive use of ring\n         modulation effects and was used in a 'Pretzel Logic' demo.\n         Composed in JCH digiplayer, tune length is 2:02.\n

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Fiasko_2.sid	COMMENT: This was in fact the first suggestion to the 'Oswald' game. I played\n         the tune to the programmer and graphician of the game but they didn't\n         like it. They loved the next attempt however, which you can find as\n         'Super_Oswald.sid'.\n         Composed in JCH player v10.G1, tune length is 0:24.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Forever_Cry.sid	COMMENT: Composed in JCH player v13, tune length is 1:22.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/George_Carl.sid	COMMENT: A long tune containing three completely different parts. The slow\n         introduction changes at 01:19 to a part which was played by the clown\n         George Carl during his shows. Here I tried to emulate a real mouth\n         organ using ring modulation.\n         Composed in JCH player v13.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Glider_Pilot.sid	  TITLE: Glider Pilot\n ARTIST: <?>\nCOMMENT: This was a conversion from an old C64 game of the same name.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Guldkornekspressen_Levels_v3.sid	COMMENT: This and the next block contains all five leveltunes crammed together\n         in one single block. Notice (3) in the block which is a conversion of\n         the music 'The Loco-Motion' - I thought it would be a nice touch to\n         such a train game. However, SilverRock thought they might get in\n         trouble if I converted it, so...

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Guldkornekspressen_Levels_v4.sid	COMMENT: (Continued from /MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Guldkornekspressen_Levels_v3.sid)\n         ...this is how it was changed to make SilverRock happy. As you can\n         hear, the difference is really not that big. Later on during the\n         programming of the game, Thomas (the programmer) realized that he\n         could not fit all the leveltunes into the game, hence this leveltune\n         was the first to go.\n         Composed in JCH player v17.\n(#3)\n  TITLE: The Loco-Motion\n ARTIST: Little Eva\nCOMMENT: Based on the version sung by Kylie Minogue.\n

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Hawaii.sid	COMMENT: A very long tune containing one of the longest solo parts I have ever\n         done in a C64 tune. The bassline and drums were originally made by\n         Morten Sigaard Kristensen, but in the end I 'raped' it so much that it\n         virtually became my own work. The solo part starts at 01:39. Notice\n         how the tune decays in the end - this was very unusual on the C64.\n         Composed in JCH player v15.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Heavy_Hit.sid	COMMENT: Short, 'end-of-level-monster'-like tune made in a compromise player\n         which took VERY little rastertime.\n         Composed in JCH player v19, tune length is 1:01.\n
/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Hexagon_Party.sid	COMMENT: Made FOR that party, not AT it. The tune contains quite a lot of\n         harmonic mistakes, something I often made in that period. These were\n         often caused by 'lazy' transpositions of the bassline sequence -\n         instead of creating a new one.\n         Composed in JCH player v2, tune length is 3:43.\n

I completed the conversion for the ridiculous sum of money.\n         Later, 'DRAX' admitted that he didn't complete the conversion because\n         he thought the original Amiga music was boring.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Tecnetium.sid	COMMENT: I always get mixed feelings when I play this music. The title- tune is\n         long and I put a lot of work into it in april 1989, but today I can\n         hear loads of harmonic errors here and there. The game was done for a\n         sideways shoot'em up which a couple of totally unknown danish guys was\n         making. They soon lost all interest in their game, however. The\n         hiscore theme was a conversion of the old Cliff Richard hit\n         'Congratulations' done right out my head. I always wanted to make such\n         a hiscore tune, because I always thought Rob Hubbard did it all wrong\n         when he made 'sad' hiscore tunes. It is a sad thing when the game\n         ends, but getting a high score is supposed to be a GOOD thing! :)\n(#1)\n   NAME: Title Screen\n(#2)\n  TITLE: Congratulations\n ARTIST: Cliff Richard\n

I don't know who penned those words, but\n         I dropped the latter half from the title because I promised said girl\n         that I would.\n         This music was made on an emulator (vice 1.8, and of course I had\n         resid turned on :-p).

The second half is mostly an\n         experiment in what happens when you mix diffrent types of Ringmod and\n         Sync effects, which I like the sound of. Sidplay1 hates it. It was\n         originally intended to sound quite different from this, because the\n         original sketch for it required a dyanmic wave table, but I got fed up\n         waiting for that, and finished it as is.'

Anyhow, around\n         2 minutes after I sat down at the editor, it instead became something\n         else (I hate it when that happens :-p), which basically amounts to an\n         attempt to place what was goes through my mind at the time into SID\n         form... the evolution of my soul.

/MUSICIANS/J/Julian_Jaymz/Midi_Drums.sid	  TITLE: Midi Drums [from the midi module]\n ARTIST: Jaymz Julian\nCOMMENT: 'This is the second attempt I made to do this song on the C64, and was\n         in fact the song that TFX table variables were created for. I\n         originally tried to do this in Sid Duzz It in early 1999, but the\n         number of arpeggio commands required for the places where there is\n         two leads in one channel, and the blips in the drum/bass channel,\n         overwelmed that editor. So I tried in JCH v20g4, where I had managed\n         to succed with Sunset Spirals, due to the ability it has to change the\n         wavetable from within a song, but this too was not to be, due to the\n         limitations of the editor. So, I started writing a new editor, which\n         was specifically designed to handle this situation, by splitting each\n         channel into six virtual channels, and using special rules to modulate\n         them together. But this took up a lot of ram and raster time, indeed\n         it too so much ram in the editor that I could only store five patterns\n         at a time, so this was not to be either. So Ray introduced me to TFX,\n         and I asked him about changing the wave table from within the song,\n         but he wouldn't have this, because it would confuse people, but he\n         suggested a viable alternative, which is to support variables in the\n         wave table, and promised to add this feature asap. That was January\n         2001, but he was too busy to implement them for the next two and a\n         half years. So I started bugging him to just give me the source and\n         the bits to build it, and in November 2003, he did. So, I put my\n         money where my mouth was, and added that feature (and a bunch of\n         others which I had been wanting for a long time), and I was _finally_\n         able to do a version of this that I happy with. To anyone else but\n         me, this is just another mediocre game tune, but for me it was an\n         achievement.' (JJ)\n

So, my\n         version is crap too, but I think it has the nice harmonies in the\n         second half, at least, and I think is a little less crap than his :).'\n         (JJ)\n

Ray had suggested to me using TFX several\n         times before, and I finally got some documentation for it, and so now\n         was the time to use it. I had the S3M of this kicking around, and so\n         I covered it to learn the editor. The instruments suck... I never was\n         good at making percussion, and unfortunantly there isn't any good ones\n         around made in TFX to rip. I also had basically zero understanding of\n         how the wave tables worked when I did this, and as a result there are\n         some very stupid things in there which sound terrible ;). This\n         probably should never have been released, but people liked it for\n         reasons that I don't understand.\n         As it turned out, the instruments sounded so crap partially because\n         Ray's player was horrifically bugged, at the time. I recompiled it\n         against a later player, and it sounds a LOT better.' (JJ)\n

I actually spent\n         a lot of time on this song, and I was quite proud of how it turned out\n         when it was finished.

/MUSICIANS/K/Kawasaki_Ryo/	COMMENT: Ryo Kawasaki's own comments are denoted (RK).\n         'When the first time Commodore 64 computer hit the market in 1984, I\n         rushed to buy it by paying $600 at some electronic store on 45th\n         street in Manhattan. It was 8-bit with only 64KB of memory. Then I\n         spent two years to write these four programs as well as unpublished\n         Midi-Workstation (8-track real-time Midi recorder) all by machine\n         code using SuperMon without assembler so that it runs fast and leave\n         enough memory for music data. Each of these programs was sold for\n         $49.95 in retail stores furnished with handsome package came with\n         5-inch floppy disk and manual. In 15 years, now we can buy 1GHz PC\n         for the same price as I bought my first C64. And I wonder what kind\n         of computer we can buy 15 years from now by paying $600?' (RK)\n

Since having no sequencer or other audio gear\n         except my Roland M5, I started doing c64 SIDs using a program called\n         AMP. It allowed to compose in a tracker-like environment, and had a\n         nice interface for creating sounds. I tried to learn several techniques\n         by covering Hubbard's Commando, but my best SID was a cover of Moroder's\n         Midnight Express.' (LMan)\n

It's a very sad song with a simple melody, supported by a\n         solemn yet rhythmical accompaniment written by Mahoney. If you're a\n         SID composer, you know that when you get a song stuck on your mind,\n         it inevitably ends up as a SID tune. =) In this case, I've tried to\n         stick to Mahoney's arrangement as far as possible.'

The tune was supposed to be exclusive, but\n         then suddenly out of the blue an old AVT-project called 'Icarus'\n         surfaced, and as my tune was first intended for that production I was\n         quite annoyed by this.

So,\n         at The Party 1 in 1991 he got the finished tune and plugged it into\n         the demo, which was then released... Syndrom liked this tune so much\n         that he did a 90% copy of it.

Access Denied\n         sample spoken by me. The bass-drumm split was make with an Amiga 500\n         and converted to my C64. Later in version v1.1 of Reflex-Tracker the\n         user could do this without directly in the trakker. Funny: most of\n         the time in this song I use only one digichannel, after release I\n         created a remix which prooves the ability of Reflex-Tracker a little\n         bit better. After winning the C64 democompo at THE PARTY'94 in\n         Denmark, most of the people thought our group name is 'Access Denied'\n         but it was 'Reflex' instead ;)' (PVCF)\n
/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Access_Denied_remix.sid	COMMENT: 'This is the remix of Access_Denied_intro.sid where I show some of the\n         features of Reflex-Tracker: 2 channels of digi-sounds, faked third\n         voice (drum and snare which are rendered in the bassvoice), volume,\n         echoeffects and flanger. All samples by me, except the 'ho ho' which\n         I have sampled from the german rap song 'Edelweiß'.' (PVCF)\n
/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Africa_Corps.sid	COMMENT: 'Interesting fact: it's a 2 channel digi music but not a\n         Reflex-Tracker tune. It's a routine which allows you theoretical add\n         3 SID voices. The music editor is named 'Perfect Sound 3.2'.\n         Unfortunately the 2 digi voices have always the speed (and pitch) of\n         the first digi voice and if you really use both voices the SID\n         channels were nearly destroyed and the CPU was down...\n         We used this track in the note file of our (Reflex) first trackmo\n         'Cafe Odd'. Later it became a very nice practice for us to use always\n         a very special notefile-soundroutine for our trackmos.\n         All (!) samples was sampled with my Phillips-Workman!!\n         Sample-software by Zork and TTS!

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Bladeswede.sid	  TITLE: px.bladeswede remix! [from the Amiga game Project-X]\n ARTIST: Allister Brimble\nCOMMENT: 'I listened to Allister Brimble's great song on Amiga and decided that\n         this song has to be remixed to the C64. Unfortunately I don't have\n         the needed amount of channels so I used a big bunch of arpeggio-lead\n         & bass-splits. The patterns looks like a exploded memorydump, it was\n         very hard to compose this with a durationeditor (DMC4.x). I really\n         forced the lead melody between the arpeggios. The music got used in\n         Access Denied trackmo-notefile with a raytraced animation and a\n         layered scroller. Regarding our tradition to use some special in our\n         trackmo-notefiles I tried a faked 4 speed tune, that means: normal\n         doublespeed routine and additionally I called the sidroutine 2 times\n         (without the filterroutine), that gives: 4speed wave and 2speed\n         filter.'

Unfortunately I\n         didn't know the trackmo (Breitbandkatze / Reflex) and the demo parts\n         during composing. You need a new SID chip, or you will miss some\n         complete channels. It's possible that this tune is the track, which I\n         would do just for fun with the goal that no voices are listenable on\n         a old SID chip. But I'm not sure if I realy have done this, its not\n         very hard to do such things ;) (my intention: all my filtereffects\n         sounds horrible on a old SID and I thought it was better to show\n         listeners with old SID nothing than crap) it was the last song which\n         I did on C64 after 5 years of SID composing. Since 2001 and now\n         (2008) I rarely compose SID tunes with QuadraSID, one or two times per\n         year.

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Thomkat_with_Strange_End.sid	COMMENT: 'DMC3 with 5 times multispeed routine. Too much bass... But the end\n         of this song is great 8) This song got never released. I did this\n         song in 1993, it sounds very 'analog', I detuned every instrument\n         a little bit at the begin of his wavetable, so the result is a very\n         organic sound. Very nice techno part at 2:00, I should remix this\n         somedays. (And I don't like techno at all)' (PVCF)\n
/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/To_Be_on_Top_Remix.sid	  TITLE: To Be on Top, Tune #1\n ARTIST: Chris Hülsbeck\nCOMMENT: Used in the game 'Black Quiz', (C) 1995 Magic Disk 64/CP Verlag.\n         'I played around whith Soundmonitor and found this song from Chris,\n         so I simply started to make this song in DMC. After 30 sec of boring\n         intro I begun to remix it with some PVCF styled elements. I never\n         released this song beside my Soundcollections 'Brainbeat'. As\n         mentioned in comments for Trance_HQ.sid and Game_Over.sid I have\n         composed lot of rock/sound-monitor songs, so I made a very very big\n         10 min remix of the original 4 channeled 'To Be on Top' by Chris,\n         so I don't gave much effort in this DMC -sid only mix.' (PVCF)\n
/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Trance_202.sid	COMMENT: 'The second Reflex-Tracker demosong, this song was released with\n         Brainbeat 4 on SideB. It shows some volume effects and wave/drum\n         splitting.' (PVCF)\n
/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Trance_HQ.sid	COMMENT: This tune was composed on an 8580 with a digi booster installed.\n         'The samples was ripped from Jeroen Tel, Rob Hubbard/Simon Nicol\n         and Chris Hülsbeck IIRC. One of my countless rockmonitor songs.\n         I composed about 8-9 months with some versions of Hülsbeck's\n         Soundmonitor and Rockmonitors and similar composing programs.\n         I made about 30-40 songs with digis, no one was released!\n         In 1997 I gave this bunch of disks to Happymaker, together with tons\n         of disks with samples... only this song and Game_Over.sid are left,\n         which I found later (1999) on a disc which was in a 1541 drive which\n         I plugged on my PC just to look if I can use StarCommander to\n         transfer stuff from a C64 disc to a harddrive.' (PVCF)\n
/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Triage_tune_2.sid	COMMENT: 'This is one of the few songs which I have made in our own SID-editor\n         called LSD (Low Sound Dealer, IIRC). Released and used in trackmo\n         'Triage' by Smash Designs. I don't know if it is a multispeeder,\n         but it sounds like a double speed DMC so it's possible that it is a\n         normal speeded LSD where I wanted to prove what's possible with this\n         great soundroutine.' (PVCF)\n
/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/execute_overdrive_intro.sid	COMMENT: 'I was very surprised in 2004 as I heard this track in a new Smash\n         Designs trackmo. Hm, I stopped composing on C64 in 1997 and in 2004\n         there appears a new song... what happened? After analyzing the chords\n         and melodies it was clear: it must be a working track, maybe a loader\n         tune for centric. AEG, which is the lead programmer of Smash Designs,\n         has the permission (since 1995) to use all PVCF-C64 songs on all C64\n         productions and so he did :) I'm not sure, but I think he used more\n         of my musics in his trackmos than we could in Reflex ;) Ah, AEG, if\n         you care (and if you read this) : I've really planned in 1992(?)\n         (after your first demo (bei nebenwirkungen essen sie die\n         packungsbeilage...)) to ask you if I could join Smash Designs, no\n         joke! But in those times my musics were so bad that I waited and then\n         I got an offer from Reflex.' (PVCF)\n
/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Early_Tunes/Mixed_Steps_on_Raining_Days.sid	COMMENT: 'This tune is 100% by me, but I made this zak for a competition where\n         the musician have to be there to compete. So I gave the tune to CDAW\n         and he competed with this track in the competition under his handle.\n         The credits for CDAW are false. It's my tune but the player on the\n         compo which are released with the song shows his name.

Generally speaking, Steve\n         was usually inspired by a riff or beat or bassline; when we went\n         clubbing, you would occasionally see him staring off into space trying\n         to pick apart a tune and memorize it.'

I had\n         released 'Apolloguys' the same day, and I had bought my Amiga 500 only\n         2 weeks before coming to this party. The first screen featured 'Like\n         Galway', and me writing a lot of text about who and what 'rambones'\n         was. The middle screen was the 'Amiga Noid' screen, with a small\n         picture of an Amiga, and a scroll telling that TST would soon rule it.\n         The last one, with this music, was a 10 point list of things about the\n         C64 that bored the hell out of me. Things like colorbars, sprites\n         moving in sinus, Hubbard alike drums/routines, all with the same sound\n         and generally everything that was in at that time. For me it was sad\n         to see a large variety of composers using more or less the same\n         routine, leaving the music in a grey state. I admire the sound of Fred\n         Gray, Martin Galway, Rob Hubbard, David Whittaker, Ben Daglish and\n         Antony Crowther, and any other programmer that built it all up from\n         scratch.'

/MUSICIANS/S/Smart_Monkey/	COMMENT: 'All these tunes were written in 1990 for my design group by a\n         friend called Arkadiusz 'Smart Monkey' Zych. They leaked from another\n         friend of mine, Pawel 'Polonus' Soltysinski, who received them from\n         me in 1991. Polonus was a member of Padua at the time. Neither me nor\n         Arkadiusz was informed about them being used in C64 productions.\n         Some of those compositions - orginally written for SID - were later\n         used by Arkadiusz in his commercial, non-computer related ventures'\n         (Silver Dream !)\n

Again, not exactly what you'd call 'a nice tune' but I was\n         just seeing what you could do with a few basic sequences by mixing and\n         transposing them. At the time I didn't really like 'acid' music, I was\n         more likely to listen to John Cage or Pierre Henry, so I wasn't really\n         sure how to write it. SoedeSoft editor again. Horrible drums again,\n         the snare being a bit like the one in Thalamusic.' (BH)\n

/MUSICIANS/S/Sonic_Graffiti/Hayes_Ben/Feedback_Experiment.sid	COMMENT: 'This tune does exactly what it says on the box, basically trying to\n         get a ring-mod effect that sounded like an electric guitar being left\n         leaning on a Marshall amplifier turned up to 11. I was fairly pleased\n         with the result, it sounds quite uncomfortable on headphones. The tune\n         was written on a SoedeSoft editor, which explains the rather fuzzy\n         triggering and messy drum sounds, but gliding and filter control was\n         much more versatile than anything else around at the time, I felt, and\n         you could sustain notes for about 5 hours. The tune was not written\n         especially for the 'Acid At The PC Show' demo, having being composed\n         around 8 weeks earlier, but Shane (coder) wanted to use them.' (BH)\n

This was done on\n         SoedeSoft (I think) at 5am on the Sunday morning of the 1989 PC Show\n         in London (hence the demo title). Has a long ending after a drum solo\n         that John Bonham would probably laugh at. I also did a version of this\n         tune in Ubiks Music in 1988, which was even worse. I hope that's never\n         found!' (BH)\n

It was never\n         meant to be released but we ended up sticking in on an SG demo disk\n         anyway. Note that one of the arpeggios is a bit wonky, and I couldn't\n         be bothered to do the start of the piece, but I felt that it was a\n         pretty good sound-a-like.' (BH)\n
/MUSICIANS/S/Sonic_Graffiti/Hayes_Ben/Greed_Monster.sid	COMMENT: 'Another day, another pointless budget game. Yogi Bear deserved\n         better! I can't remember if I composed the tune or if it was a\n         conversion of some Atari ST music, written by some bloke who's name I\n         can't remember. We used to do a few conversions back then. These were\n         great fun to do. The software company would sent Gerard Gourley a copy\n         of the original music, usually recorded on a cassette recorder sitting\n         by the TV. He'd then play the tune down the telephone to me, and I'd\n         record it on another cassette from the telephone's earpiece. The\n         resulting hi-fidelity master recording would then be my basis. I\n         usually had to guess at the basslines, as they'd become totally\n         inaudible on the tape. Then I'd U-U the result back to Gerard within 2\n         hours, and if I was lucky I'd get £100 about 6 months later after the\n         'middle man' had taken his bit. Or half that if the tune was for\n         Ocean.' (BH)\n

I quite liked\n         it at the time, but more for the effects than the rather scrappy lead\n         lines. Tune #4 was totally different in style, for the hiscore table.\n         [...] To be honest, music for this sort of game was an afterthought\n         - and for the money I was getting, I wasn't about to try and write an\n         epic!'

/MUSICIANS/T/Taylor_Stuart/Sky_Runner.sid	COMMENT: 'I had been commissioned by Orpheus Software (ironically the makers of\n         Electrosound) to code the music for their game Sky Runner. They sent\n         me a work-in-progress version of the game along with a\n         sort-of-completed Electrosound composition. They wanted me to\n         transpose this to a non-Electrosound version and make it my own - what\n         you hear on here is the end result. Unfortunately the MD of Orpheus at\n         the time was a complete nightmare to work with - I was young and naive\n         at the time but this was my first experience, commercially, of trying\n         to get money out of someone. He just wouldn't pay - kept saying cheque\n         would be in the post, give it another week or so etc etc....looking at\n         Sky Runner for the first time ever (on here) it looks like the\n         programmer's deal with Orpheus went pretty sour as well. I see the\n         game was published by another software house (Cascade?) and the music\n         had gone back to it's original Electrosound composition - obviously I\n         had no dealings with Cascade - they probably didn't even know about my\n         arrangement!!.... About 1 year later, under new management, Orpheus\n         approached me again asking me to do some more music. OK, I said,\n         firstly you pay me for Sky Runner and secondly I want the money for\n         the new music (I think it was an adaption of some board game involving\n         moving buses around London???) up front - they obliged so there was a\n         happy ending to this story.'

Probe Software then heard the\n         tune and asked Jeroen if he'd change the samples, and lo and behold it\n         became the Savage theme.\n         'Some background info. The 'KOUD HE' sample is from a Dutch comedian\n         called 'Harry Vermeegen'. It was like a hype saying. I found it a nice\n         sample to play around with.

OUTRUN\n         EUROPE was never finished (at least not the first version). I don't\n         know why/when/where/how.\n         Then Turbo Outrun was made. (you know the music, etc.) One of the two\n         title-tunes (not the 1.2.3. hit-it! one) was actually composed for\n         Outrun Europe.\n         OUTRUN EUROPA in 1990 is a totally different game from the old\n         unfinished, never released game in 1988/1989.'

However, the game was never completed and the programming\n         team involved went on to do Turbo Outrun instead. This was also a\n         different game from Outrun Europa, released in 1991.

/MUSICIANS/W/Walker_Martin/Walkers_Warbles.sid	COMMENT: 'Walker's Warbles' was a Martin Walker music demo which came as a free\n         giveaway with the disk version of 'Armalyte' by Thalamus (which MW did\n         the music for.) Tune #3 is an early version of what would eventually be\n         used in the game 'Dominion' bundled on a Zzap! 64 covertape in 1990,\n         and tune #4 is an early version of the 'Aggressor Theme'. The final\n         version of this (and the one which Revolution uses) is the one on MW's\n         'Zzap! 64 Music Demo' which appeared on Zzap 64's June 1989 covermount\n         cassette. (Comment by Warren Pilkington)\n(#4)\nCOMMENT: This tune was also used in a game called Revolution (written by Simon\n         Pick). The game was never released, but featured on Commodore Format\n         magazine's powerpack (tape) number one.\n

/MUSICIANS/W/Waz/Worktunes/Arsenal.sid	COMMENT: 'This was a work in progress of the title tune for the Arsenal FC\n         game licence which never was released. I wanted to use a football\n         type handclap chant as the main drum, and then throughout the title\n         tune it was going to reference some football songs with the drum\n         backing. The disk was thought to be lost when I moved house many\n         years ago, but found an unlabelled disk, and saw the file names on\n         there. When I loaded them into Ubik's Musik it was indeed this,\n         so pretty good to salvage it all round.\n         On the same disk as the Arsenal title tune, I'd put together a few\n         sound effects which could have played when you were playing the game\n         of football. I was also considering some football chants such as\n         those I'd used in the Football Tunes demo as well.' (WP)\n

/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Action_Biker_Remix.sid	  TITLE: Action Biker, Tune #1\n ARTIST: Rob Hubbard\nCOMMENT: 'This is a remix from Rob Hubbard's Action Biker main theme (tune #1)\n         from the year 1985! (C) Mastertronic. Listen to the original and hear\n         the difference! I first typed over the notes (bass + lead) from a Music\n         Assembler example tune. Not using the ugly percussion track. The\n         chords are typed over from a Midi file called Biker. (Lazy me eh?!).\n         Maybe this will not be necessary in future because there is a Midi to\n         Mod program and buddy Roland Hermans has made a Mod to Sid program.\n         I'm not quite happy with this tune because of the weak 2 notes\n         arpeggio part (from 1:14 to 1:50). I made the volume of this arpeggio\n         part a bit softer so it becomes a bit less annoying. Maybe I will\n         improve this tune sometime. Same presets used as in Rolfie Title\n         Remix. Typing over the notes took some amount of time (I always work\n         slowly!). I used too many sequences in the 2nd track (it can only\n         handle 128). So Roland Hermans 'packed' several sequences into only a\n         few so the player can handle them. This is the 2nd tune for mainly\n         Polish based group Axelerate. Tune is played at CIA 1 Timer A (PAL)\n         because we wanted another speed than a normal one. Tune has nice\n         ending, don't you agree? Hope you like it!' (JW)\n
/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Advanced_Space_Battle.sid	COMMENT: 'I went into this project wanting to write a 'classic' SID that people\n         want to listen to frequently perhaps even like a good 80s game SID.\n         Soon I noticed I had too few good ideas myself so I used some\n         'borrowed' music in this one in true Rob Hubbard style (he also covered\n         a lot as you know). So some of other composer's music was the basis of\n         some tunes varied with own ideas and combinations of these 2. Of course\n         Roland Hermans (Neo) helped me with the technical bits.' (JW)\n(#1)\n   NAME: Intro Tune\nCOMMENT: 'The short intro jingle still went some work in it being quite complex.\n         The end sounds particularly well with that kick sound attached to the\n         bass.'

It's\n         simple to do and still sounds great. The combination with the Matrix\n         tune works well I think. Also I listened to a lot of hard rock/heavy\n         metal music to get inspired. A lot of what Matt Gray did can be\n         identified with this style. Using double bass plus MG drums is a good\n         combination plus after that a ring modulation lead sounds nice.' (JW)\n(#3)\n   NAME: Massive Attack\nCOMMENT: 'Massive Attack begins with 2 tracks shooting SFX from the game\n         Dominator. Then a Star Wars alike film tune. The piece after that the\n         Jon Dunn's Robocop lead instrument fits and sounds so well! Some funny\n         kicks and snares in different volumes. The last piece is very short 'n\n         simple and still sounds good. Only a few sequences used. About 4 if I\n         remember well.' (JW)\n(#4)\n   NAME: Arduous Battle\nCOMMENT: 'Arduous Battle is completely done by me. In a lot of places the bass\n         notes are harder on the beat. In this I made a 64 version of a tune I\n         composed on the Amiga with Protracker which was called Freedom.

The break in this part is my\n         friend Roland's favourite (You know him from the PSID64 program). And\n         the last part is composed by myself using some Galway  Rambo tune #5\n         instruments which I made a bit harder volume wise. Oh yes the\n         instrument of the arpeggios is an enhanced version of Jason Brooke's\n         Bismarck arp. preset.' (JW)\n(#7)\n   NAME: Space Explorer\nCOMMENT: 'Space Explorer has a very mysterious intro. As you can hear Philip\n         Glass is one of my favourite composers. Jam jam! Sounds very nice!

But the\n         tune uses 2 tracks for the part which isn't the lead or bass. How do\n         you call that part anyway? (backing?) While going through old Amiga\n         500 games with buddy Roland (we were looking through because we are\n         planning a C64 demo consisting converted Amiga pics in FLI-Interlace)\n         we stumbled upon this tune. I like it very much so I tried if I could\n         rip it with my Datel Electronics' Amiga Action Replay MK III. I froze\n         the game and typed in tracker. And golly yes! The cartridge found the\n         tune and I saved it to disc and loaded it in my Protracker soundtool.\n         Together with Roland I converted it. (He works much quicker than me).\n         We are planning to do more conversions. After this conversion Roland\n         made a program to convert from MOD to SID, right into my player as\n         I said in Action Biker Remix STIL text. But now it even converts\n         arpeggios! The presets are: bass from Psycho Pigs UXB. Flute resembles\n         Amiga lead sample instrument but has a little waveform 41 tick at\n         the beginning and is made by Roland. Other preset is from Henning\n         Rokling's Henning_Rokling-02.sid which is used in demo Wild At Heart.\n         We first made an arpeggio sound consisting of two different c notes\n         but it didn't work out well. In beginning of the tune you can hear a\n         build up of decay and sustain in this preset. To get this effect we\n         had to make 4 presets just changing the decay and sustain from 2 to 8.\n         The wave on effects on bass and Rokling preset make it sound ok on\n         C64. Often this effect is used to substitute normal hi hat sounds.\n         This ditty is one of my favourite tunes!' (JW)\n

I made a pc version\n         of it for a children's music project (Knorrie On The Farm translated)\n         which sounds much better because you can have as many tracks as you\n         want and you can use instruments that sound like real ones (VSTi's).\n         But I think the SID also has its charm!'

/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Robin_Hood_Intro.sid	  TITLE: The Adventures of Robin Hood intro [from the Amiga game]\n ARTIST: Richard Joseph\nCOMMENT: 'This is a conversion of one of my favourite Amiga tunes. Again I had\n         to squeeze the 4 tracks into 3. So I had to leave out some things but\n         you don't really miss them. Roland did a fine job with the\n         instruments. Especially the lead instrument starting from 0:24 is\n         great! This tune was used in the Richard Joseph Tribute Demo in the\n         intro and in the music menu as well.' (JW)\n
/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Robocod_ingame.sid	  TITLE: James Pond II - RoboCod (toys) [from the Amiga game]\n ARTIST: Richard Joseph\nCOMMENT: 'I went through several RJ tunes to make a SID cover for the Richard\n         Joseph Tribute Demo. I was very attracted by the 'James Pond II -\n         Codename RoboCod' Amiga tunes. I saw the best tune catlots a.k.a.\n         ingame 1 was already covered in the C64 version of the game so I chose\n         the 'toys' tune which is also great. Good thing the original is also\n         in 3 tracks so I didn't have to leave anything out. Again some nice\n         instruments by Roland!' (JW)\n
/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Rolfie_Title_Remix.sid	COMMENT: 'This is a remix of the title theme I made for a children's cd rom I\n         am making together with some pallies of mine. The cd rom is called\n         'Rolfie Op Wereldreis' which is translated: 'Rolfie On A World Trip'\n         and is about a cat which travels around the world visiting 10\n         countries from which England and America are divided into 2 pages. So\n         in total there are 12 different country drawings, a title page, a\n         credits page and and end page. With every page there comes an\n         appropriate, spheric music plus lyrics about what can be seen in the\n         drawings. All the sight seeing objects can be seen in a picture of\n         each country. For instance in Egypt you can see: some pyramids, a\n         sphinx, the Nile, a palm tree, some background items and Rolfie the\n         cat on a camel. When you click on an object it starts to animate and a\n         WAV-file begins to play making e.g. a camel sound and telling a story\n         about e.g. a camel. This title tune is apart from the melody altered\n         heavily to let it sound ok on the C64. This is the first tune I made\n         since 1992 which was spread, so you can call it a sort of test tune.\n         And this is also the first tune made for mainly Poland based group\n         Axelerate which has died in the beginning of 2001. All presets are the\n         same as in Linko music except before every bass sound (from 0:15),\n         there is a kick drum sound added. Idea for 3 track chords in beginning\n         is from Reyn Ouwehand's Deadlock (brilliant title tune). Wind sound\n         was added, as always if something needs to be added, it was done by\n         pally Roland 'Neo' Hermans. Hope U like it!' (JW)\n

/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Truman_Sleeps.sid	  TITLE: Truman Sleeps [from the movie]\n ARTIST: Philip Glass\nCOMMENT: 'The 3rd Glass cover partially covered from a midi file.

It's the eight tune used in Arachnophobia mag #24 which\n         makes that mag a true Yogibear special! What I learned from this tune\n         is that the $11 wave form (in this case flute sound) is a good choice\n         to use for the 2nd lead voice which is of course less dominant than\n         the 1st. Thanx again to Neo for helping with the presets but in the\n         future I hope I can do them myself as I'm learning how my music player\n         and the SID chip works.' (JW)\n

It was first intended to be a high score music for\n         a shoot'em up from Protovision, but they didn't want covers in their\n         games. Roland and I first put the filter on the arpeggios like Robocop\n         title but in most cases it is best to put it on the bass like we did\n         in this tune. I think this is one of the best basslines I ever heard.\n         It's pretty complex! Chris is/was probably the best German computer\n         zax composer ever. I think! The arpeggios are not chords they consist\n         of 2 notes. Lead is from Dunn's Robocop title, rest by Roland. Hope U\n         like it!' (JW)\n

And that's what I did. That\n         background preset thingie was taken from X-Out, which was used there\n         as lead. Again a midi file was the basis for this one. From 0:50 an\n         extra effect was added courtesy Roland. Thanx! I must say it sounded\n         really cool on the party with that thumping bass!
