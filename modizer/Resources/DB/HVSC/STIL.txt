/DEMOS/0-9/128_Byte_Blues_BASIC.sid
COMMENT: "When I first had a look at the 512b/1k Tiny SID compo, I thought it'd
         be a great way to get back into doing some assembly language on the
         C=64 (which I haven't done for a long time). I spent a fair amount of
         time thinking of the best way to reduce the size and decided that one
         of the best ways would be to really challenge myself and to squeeze
         some music out of 128 bytes just for fun.
         I really wanted to feature the nature of the C=64, so I thought about
         several ways to best store the note and instrument data. After a few
         sketches, I found that I seemed to be wasting a lot of space trying to
         store both the note and duration data, so I decided that the best way
         would be to derive the notes and durations directly from the C=64
         memory and just index into a basic blues scale and generate some
         music. It took a bit of playing around with techniques, but I found
         that utilizing individual bits to step up or down within the scale
         generated the most musical results. Somewhat of a 1-bit DPCM technique
         except for successive music notes in a scale instead of successive
         samples. So, the code basically cycles through the bits which are
         displayed in the screen memory and uses them to generate the notes.
         The note duration is set by combining the jiffy clock and the cursor
         countdown to give some flex to the tempo. I found that staying in one
         note sequence was boring, so I made it step through two blues scales.
         I tried to squeeze out more space by removing the low byte of the
         frequency but found that it either made the music too out of tune or
         too high in pitch. I also attempted to add a second voice, but ran out
         of space. I really liked the idea of adding something to watch while
         it's playing, so the colours change as it is reading through the bytes
         of screen memory. Rolling the bits of screen memory had the additional
         benefit that the bytes would return to their original form after
         passing over them eight times when the sequence repeats. Since the
         tempo is partially derived from the cursor blink, it is possible to
         change the tempo while moving the cursor. The sequence of notes can
         also be modified by typing in the upper portion of the screen.
         It should sound fine on any C=64 (NTSC/PAL), SID (6581/8580) or good
         emulator (VICE, PowerPC etc..). I've had great fun working on this
         piece and hope others have fun listening and playing around with it as
         well." (Freaky DNA)

         first music disk was completely broken when it arrived, so I recovered
         all that I could (almost) hear and composed the full tunes from the
         beginning. When I got the second disk, I realised that the tunes I
         modified, were not composed for the game parts I used them in.
         Moreover, they told me that my compositions were a lot better than
         his!!! Only the final track, the one that plays during the end titles
         (tune #6), remained untouched. Furthermore, I didn't write about this
         on the title screen, since actually the basic sound was created by

         that there are 4 different versions of the same tune. This was because
         we couldn't decide whether to create a 'clean' version of the tune or
         an auto of tune version to more closely copy the Spectrum version.

COMMENT: This is a remix of /MUSICIANS/M/Mueller_Markus/Coco_Intro.sid
         In a demo by Edwin van Santen, which he released about two years after
         Coco Intro was made popular in the Papillion's crack intro, he claims
         that he in fact composed the music. This demo contained a new version
         of the tune (this sid). He explains how he had made the music two
         years earlier on some composer like Soundmonitor or something similar.
         While at a copyparty, someone supposedly stole his music disk which
         had the tune on it. This was his only copy of the tune. About two
         months later, the tune appeared on a Papillions' intro and no credit
         was given to van Santen. See /MUSICIANS/M/Mueller_Markus/Coco_Intro.sid

         from me. At that time I hadn't any player and I didn't want to spend
         too much time in making one. I ripped the 20CC player by analyzing the
         code in assembler. Then I programmed the codeblocks myself to get the
         Lambada tune right. I laughed when 20CC found out that their player
         was used and Falco Paul or Edwin van Santen hadn't made that tune
         earlier!!! They accused me of ripping routines etc. etc. Well.. they
         were right, I never claimed that it was my player but I merged my
         Lambada tune blocks via assembler into their old music blocks (I
         overwrote it). The funniest thing was that the Lambada tune from me
         was very populair at that time. When 20CC heard it they made their own
         Lambada tune, hehehehe..." (Patrick Peters)

         work on a ninja style and more fun tune to suit the game.So rather
         than put this into the wastebin, I have decided to share the
         ninjaesque dance tune with you all instead. There are 2 main tunes

         at the end of the working day, I felt rather stressed, so I decided to
         dig out the DMC V5.0+ and compose something to make me feel better.
         Did it make me feel better? Yes, it sure did. This tune never actually
         got released, apart from on a TND intro. This is the usual traditional
         Richard Bayliss dance/disco style of tune, which some people would
         love or hate." (RB)

         was originally entered for the X-2008 music compo, but I was
         unfortunate to not have been able to enter this tune into the compo,
         as the organizers disallowed email music submissions this time round.
         Probably because of the amount of music entries they received. They
         did enter my demo, Crazy Fish into the compo. The music later got used
         as the tape loading music for the Mayhem in Monsterland music mix.
         Glad I found some use for this nice piece of music. I feel that this
         tune is probably one of my best efforts so far," (RB)

COMMENT: "I was thrown into the deep end with this. I had three weeks to
         produce the music and sound effects for the C64, Spectrum, and
         Amstrad versions, which included time to write a music driver for the
         C64. It was a good learning experience but I wish I had more time to
         work on the tunes as most of my efforts went into writing the software.
         I remember listening to the music form The Last Ninja and Wizball at
         that time, trying to figure out how they created the sounds so I could
         write my music driver. Martin Galway later told me how he created the
         high pitched wooden block 'pop' sound, which was achieved by running
         the driver at 240Hz." (GB)

COMMENT: "I programmed and produced the music and sound effects for this game

         from the talented guys at Ocean and put them to work in this game.
         32 sprite multiplexing, near full-screen colour scrolling, and sampled
         sounds." (GB)

         working on this. Paulie Hughes wrote a new C64 driver as Martin had
         just left Ocean, and nobody could understand how to use his driver."

/MUSICIANS/B/Bjerregaard_Johannes/Thunderforce.sid
COMMENT: "I wrote most of Thunderforce together with my highschool friend Peter
         Uhd Jespsen. The game was originally written for the Danish company
         called Keleline. Peter was a big fan of Depeche Mode and had most of
         their records. Therefore we wanted to get some tunes from DM in the
         game. Keleline wrote to DM and first got a yes, but then the group
         decided no. At least that was the story we were told, but I think,
         that the director of the company cheated us. Somewhere out there is a
         small demo, which have the five tunes in it."

  TITLE: Mystified [from the Amiga MOD module]
 ARTIST: Jogeir Liljedahl
COMMENT: Prior to public release, GRG believed this tune was originally done on
         the Amiga by Liljedahl. According to GRG, when fellow countryman Geir
         Tjelta heard the SID, Tjelta informed GRG that he thought the original
         was actually done by Bug (Stein Erik Giske) rather than Liljedahl.
         Tjelta also informed GRG that Bug passed away in 1992 thus giving GRG
         inspiration to rename the tune before releasing publicly. Unfortunately
         Tjelta's credit information was incorrect, however Tjelta does not
         recall giving GRG incorrect credits perhaps suggesting there was a
         miscommunication between the two. Another theory is that there may
         have been confusion between Jogeir's "Mystified" and one of Bug's
         tunes named "Slider" where the first few notes are similar but indeed
         the two tunes are very different. Reflecting back, Jogeir Liljedahl, a
         friend and group member of the late Bug, adds the following: "When it
         comes to Mystified, it's 100% my original tune. I haven't even thought
         about the similarities to Bug's Slider tune, but the 5-6 first notes
         of the song are similar to Mystified. But it's a completely different
         song of course. Either me or Bug noticed that back then, and Bug was
         a huge fan of Mystified, since he was among the first to hear the song
         (along with Olav Rasmus Vorren aka Shorty)."

         is a sad story for both the family to the user, and the user itself,
         which later in the song dies, it's the user's last flight. The family
         which stands back with their dead son or daughter is so unhappy and
         sad that they don't know anything anymore. They're feeling a huge
         emptyness inside, they only wish their child back again, staying
         alive. But that will never happen... The last few minutes when the
         child was alive, it dreamed about a sky of marvelous and wonderful
         things flying all around. The longer it lasted the longer away this
         person was to all real things we know here on earth. This child, so
         young, has left the world. Not alive anymore. Doesn't exist, only the
         body left for the family to bury and their memories to keep. Why do
         some want to legalize it?" (KN)

         I can recall the work of XTD and Jester. Having a look on the info
         part inside the the tune I realized we aparently must have followed
         the legal situation in Poland of those years, where actually you could
         legally buy pirated copies of commercial records! Why is that? Well,
         the info says (C)1994 Caution, (C)1995 Amorphis but actually the tune
         doesn't belong to any of these groups, right? It is a mix of
         originally someone's else work. The (C) sign there is merely just an
         indication of what groups released, or used this tune. It was meant
         firstly to be used in 1994 in a Caution production but used only in
         1995 in the music collection by our group Amorphis." (MK)

/MUSICIANS/B/Brennan_Neil/
COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Brennan to be his.
         The HVSC team via their sources have checked all the original credits
         and found that most of the tunes that were supposedly done by Greg
         Holland were in fact made by Neil Brennan. For most of the games Greg
         Holland was the graphic artist rather than the composer. The HVSC Crew
         also has confirmation of this fact from a senior employee of Beam
         Software, who was on Melbourne House's main programming team at the
         time. Brennan's own comments are denoted (NB).
         "The only musician I knew at Melbourne House pre-me (I think I started
         in 1983) was Adrian Pertout. A guy named Gavin Anderson (I think) came
         after me, but I lost contact with that company fairly quickly, so I'm
         a pretty poor source of information." (NB)

         China. Information comes from the liner notes for "Phases of the
         Moon", a 1981 compact disk published by CBS Records.
         "Fred Milgrom (founder of MH) gave me heaps of latitude, for which I
         can only be grateful. I actually studied Chinese and Japanese
         recordings and instruments for some of these pieces, absurdly serious
         as that may sound." (NB)

COMMENT: "[...] But now let me tell something about this music. It was composed
         and tracked within  hours on january, 23rd. This is a kind of jazz
         tune, it's not my style ya know, but I felt like doing a tune like
         this because lots a people like it. Therefore I added sum of my music
         style to the tune, that's why it sounds a bit techno like.. Try to
         enjoy this tune with a stereo, you'll like it I guess.. By the way
         remember that all C128 computers have a different filter set on their
         sid chips,so the music sounds a bit different than on normal C64
         computers, you'll hear the difference on the bass, the filters doesn't
         open theirselves so much on C128! But who the fuck cares, this music
         runs on all computers, that's what counts! [...]"

         it. The story goes that myself and Pete where hired to do the music
         for £600. When we delivered they turned around and said, ahh yes but
         we've had to pay £200 to get the sound effects done so here's

COMMENT: "This Elite game involved flying a plane around and bombing stuff. I
         think it was based on an overhead view. Version 1 of the music has the
         633 Squadron theme for tune 1 but for copyright reasons I had to redo
         the music using an original tune. This tune was not as good as the
         633 tune but I probably had the minimum time to come up with
         something." (MC)

COMMENT: "When I was interviewed by Brian Wilcox at Elite for a job they sent
         me home with a little task to prove that I had some computer and
         progamming skills. The task was to make the Oric Atmos computer I had
         at home play the theme tune to Airwolf. Over the weekend I managed to
         get the tune playing using a very simple assembler that I had written
         in basic. As a result I got the job at Elite and the first thing they
         had me doing was programming the Airwolf tune on the C64 as they were
         doing a game based on the TV show. After this I found myself doing
         music all the time and that is how I got started." (MC)

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Airwolf_II.sid
COMMENT: Heavily inspired by Harold Faltermeyer's Axel F.
         "This is a rather peculiar tune, I can't remember anything about this
         game really, must be based on a helicopter (but not necessarily so
         knowing elite). The tune sounds vaguely Egyptian or Arabic." (MC)

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Battle_Island.sid
COMMENT: "I never saw this game, I received a phone call and was asked to do
         the music. I had a feeling though that the game might be a bit like
         Commando so I did a tune that was kind of inspired by Rob Hubbard's
         music for that game. Of course it's nowhere near as good as maestro
         Rob's tune but it's certainly not the worst tune I ever did." (MC)

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Battle_Ships.sid
COMMENT: "This game was based on the well known board game. Tune 2 is a weird
         victory ditty that was composed by my brother. Tune 3 I think is the
         highscore music and tune 4 is the ingame music, just a 2 channel
         ambient track which left 1 channel for sfx. Tune 5 seems to be corrupt
         and out of sync for some reason but was meant to be used for action
         parts of the game." (MC)

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Bomb_Jack.sid
COMMENT: Does not cover the arcade version.

         The title tune is a Jean-Michel Jarre cover. We used to copy tunes
         like this all the time in the early days, I think the legislation at
         the time didn't cover computer based music, that situation didn't last
         very long though and we then needed to do original compositions
         (supposedly). Only tune 2 is from the original arcade machine.
         I seem to remember that in the original version of the music I used
         Lady Madonna by the Beatles." (MC)

COMMENT: "Without doubt the game which is most closely associated with me.
         The highscore tune (1) is a copy from the original arcade machine.
         However, having listened to the in game tune which was a complicated
         harpsichord tune using lots of channels, I decided to compose my own
         ghostly tune. Again the tune is not completely original using elements
         from several sources including Chopin and other bizarre sources (my
         mom's old organ vinyl records from the 70's). I'm still mystified
         about why I went for that strange percussion but it seems to work
         somehow." (MC)

COMMENT: "I remember this project very well because most of Elite went down to
         the 20th Cent Fox HQ in London. We had a private pre-release screening
         of Gremlins II in their mini cinema, kitted out with surround sound.
         The computer press were invited and Steve Wilcox gave a talk before
         the film was screened. After wards we went to a Thai restaurant but
         being a potatoes & gravy man I passed on the food and hot footed it
         home. Worryingly, listening to the music I'm not 100% sure if I did it
         or not. I think I did cause certain elements sound like my music but
         the highscore tune (No 6) sounds far too good. Perhaps by 1990 I had
         improved the music player routine and decided to do a good job for
         this game." (MC)

         a particularly catchy theme so I did an original composition. The tune
         is a bit on the weird side but I thought that it went quite well with
         the fairly slow pace of the cycling round the streets bit of the game.
         On the coin op there were a number of speech samples and some of these
         were put into the Amiga version of the game which did have the

         pop meets the 16th century type theme. Tune 3, the win ditty sounds
         much like one of the Bombjack ditties! I must have felt a bit lazy on
         that day. Tune 1 is the highscore tune and I have done a full version
         of this on keyboard etc. The people who developed this game had a
         pokey little room on the upper story of a computer store in Walsall
         before they moved into more spacious offices. I can't remember much

COMMENT: All tunes but tune #4 are based on the arcade version.
         "I used to love playing this arcade machine when we had got it at the
         offices at Elite, those Easter Island type stone heads that flew
         towards you were especially effective. The original in game tune had
         got a memorable melody so I decided to stick to it. The middle section
         of my version may be original though, the tune plays a little faster
         than on the arcade machine. This was due to the fact that my routine
         didn't contain a fractional timer at that point. Speeds were
         determined by the shortest note length which could be 1,2,3 or 4 etc.
         The speed differences were thus 100%, 50,33% etc. with no in between
         values. The rest of the tunes in the set are original compositions I
         think, maybe tune 2 was close to the arcade version." (MC)

         Tune 1 has a kind of John Carpenter feel, tune 2 is a Bach influenced
         piece, tune 3 is a very echoey menacing tune. Tune 4 is an action type
         tune, tune 5 is a durge, tune 6 is game over, tune 7 is a dancey
         highscore tune and tune 8 is another ingame tune." (MC)

COMMENT: "The developer of this game was a company called Arc Developments.

         work for them on other games systems. The plan was to do rock music
         for this game but it ended up sounding a little weak and slow.
         This was probably the last C64 music I did before I moved on to other
         platforms such as the original gameboy and SNES etc. The person who
         used to pay the cheques out at Arc used to make me jump through hoops
         to get my money, he was just taking the p*ss and sometimes I couldn't

         "Shamefully, this was written at the time when SID emulation was not
         at its best. There is a cymbal-crash sound that I expected to play
         with a phase-shifting effect, not knowing at the time that you need to
         set the waveforms to $91-$9f and then do a hard-restart with $09 on
         the next frame. Due to this lack of knowledge, this can't be heard
         when played on a real C64 (with 2 SID chips) or on recent versions of

COMMENT: "This is the music for the game which was originally titled "Perplex".
         In the beginning DRAX did the soundtrack for the game while I made
         the sfx. At some time during the production of the music, DRAX thought
         he could use some help and I agreed to do some of the music. While the
         music and sfx was done in 1990, the game was put on ice by the
         Austrian guys as they became tired of it. Some years later they
         revived the project, finished it, and sold it to a German software
         house under the new name, "Hermetic"". (JCH)

  TITLE: Rubicon, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Jeroen Tel
COMMENT: "They wanted a title-theme for Shock Magazine, and gave me the first
         issue. There was a song in there, and I had no clue what it really
         was but thought it captured the feel of the entire magazine. So I
         simply made a cover of it, Danko style. I never had any hangups about
         having to do it all, music is all about sharing and developing ideas
         together in order to reach higher grounds. The chords aren't
         identical to Jeroen's version, in fact we had a little thing over
         that at a party in Oslo back in '94 or so. We hung over a keyboard
         and I played the chords my style, and he went like 'No! It's like
         THIS!' and I said 'Well, I want it THIS way!'. *grin* One of the guys
         at the party leaned over to me and whispered that he in fact
         preferred my version of the track. *smirk* Jeroen superimposed a sus2
         chord throughout the progression until it folds back to the tonic,
         where the sus2 becomes a m7. It's a nice move, one that I personally
         use quite a lot myself. But this time around I expanded the
         progression to plain chords following the bassline.
         After I had done the tune I found out that it was from Rubicon, but
         to me it doesn't matter.
         Later on I made a remix of it, called it Schizomix, with weird
         sounds. Because Rubicon had been a double-speed song, or something
         similar, I wanted to make weird and similar sounds but in a single-
         speed player. And that's all it was, a messed up version of my first
         cover so to speak." (TD)

COMMENT: The corresponding game for this music was never released for the

         platforms in 1990. Deenen's C64 efforts weren't in vain, however, as
         he was able to reuse much of the music and began a new phase of his
         career. In a 2006 posting, Deenen's reflects: "If I hadn't done the
         C64 Lord of the Rings stuff I wouldn't have gotten my first
         'full-time' job in the US. I'd probably be struggling in Holland now
         trying to make it as a programmer or music guy."

COMMENT: This is a worktune found in Charles Deenen workdisks, made in 1988.
         "This was made for fun. I do recall a bit of a "too strong"
         inspiritation from a Rambo soundtrack. Something that was done in like
         an hour or so, probably to test out a new pulse-width routine, hence
         why it sounds so unpolished and unfinished." (CD)

COMMENT: "After we got the contract [for Gordian Tomb] with a good value of
         money, we discussed how to divide it to the people. This was a mess.
         We at least lost some days of programming. Michael [Detert] was
         menacing with a dropout if Thomas didn't compose the music. So I
         thought ok, we are a team and I am busy with programming - why not?
         But then we couldn't unite about the amount of money. Thomas should
         get the twice of a normal level for a salary. If I had been a better
         businessman these days I had done everything by myself, but at least
         we had a great time and a lot of fun. And the teamwork was always
         accurate. Finally Thomas had known that the salary was overdrawn and
         he repaid every dollar with the longest music ever [32:06 minutes] on
         commodore 64." (Info from Markus Schneider).
(#1)
COMMENT: The original release has a protection which overlaps a fraction of
         the music data, causing dirty sounds in this tune (most notably, the
         bass). The game was also released without protection and with correct
         data, which is present in this rip.

COMMENT: MC Hammer used the original tune as the main rhythm for "U Can't

         While the the Amiga versions of Demonware's games The Power and Ooops
         Up had digitracks of the Snap songs, Detert was instructed NOT to do a
         cover of The Power by Snap for this soundtrack, obviously the guys at
         Snap meanwhile changed their minds about their agreement with
         Demonware.
         The C64 version of Ooops Up was never finished, early soundtrack
         versions done by Rodney Balai did feature a cover of the Snap song
         though. (see /MUSICIANS/A/Audial_Arts/Balai_Rodney/Ooops_Up.sid)

         the version of the Biene Maja tune where there are these cheesy sound
         fx inside from the bees falling down. :-) This version of the tune

         Antimon instead. Most of my music had been used by them anyway. This

         Chortles" featuring Jason Mackenzie (Kenz) and friends in really manic
         scenes and behaviour, including setting fire to a Spectrum, re-making
         a Pepsi ad, lots of playing C64 Games and strange footage. The voice
         of Kenz is heard in the "Xmas Chortles" and "Merry Christmas" samples.
         According to Feekzoid, this tune was never supposed to be released.

COMMENT: "I wrote it around '84 or '85 as a demo for my music editor called
         'Synth'. I was going to University of Waterloo at the time and just
         gave it to a friend of mine... didn't even bother to put my name on
         the thing. Anyway it soon started cropping up all over the place.
         I never made any sequels with music, although there was something with
         annoying sound effects done in the same style as Synth Sample that I
         posted in the beginning of 1994. So any music you see that looks like
         a sequel or has graphics added was done by someone else.
         Anyway the computer bust of 85/86(?) hit and Synth was never marketed.
         I had been negotiating with a software company but they went out of
         business. By that time I was working on a new version of Synth that
         was a sequencer program for Midi instruments (called MSS), and had
         joined my first band. I've been in a couple other bands since then,
         the last one was called SugarPush and we came close to getting signed
         (but then broke up [...]). So I guess you can credit that little
         program with launching my musical career..." (GF)

COMMENT: G-Fellow' (Gerhard Flagge's) own comments are denoted (G-F).
         G-Fellow started composing in 1988 and after a break from
         1991-1998, he did some tunes in 1998 that got released later.
         In 2004 G-Fellow made a comeback in the Commodore 64 scene. His early
         tunes from 1991 and 1998 didn't get released until 2004.

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Arkanoid.sid
COMMENT: This is the very first published tune on the C64 that used samples.
         "Q: How did you get involved with using sampled sounds?
         MG: I figured out how samples were played by hacking into someone
         else's code... OK, I admit it... It was a drum synthesizer package
         called Digidrums, actually, so you could still say I was the first to
         include samples in a piece of music. [...] Never would I claim to have
         invented that technique, I just got it published first. In fact, I
         couldn't really figure out where they got the sample data, just that
         they were wiggling the volume register, so I tried to make up my own
         drum sample sounds in realtime - which is the flatulence stuff that
         shipped in 'Arkanoid'. [...] After the project was in the shops I
         gained access to some real drum samples, and I slid those into my own
         custom version of the tune. The one that's in the shops is kind of a
         collage of farts & burps, don't you think? [...] Later I was able to
         acquire some proper drum samples and by 'Game Over' it got quite
         sophisticated." (MG)

COMMENT: "The Miami Vice game was a very quick job. I had been handed 'Miami
         Vice' and 'Highlander' because the outside development team working on
         it hadn't worked out who was going to do the sound (notice those games
         have little or no sound-effects), so I did my best in a very short
         time. I [...] picked 'The Chase' and the 'Main Theme' as the two tunes
         I would do. We had settled on two modes for the game - in your car and
         out of it I think. (Or maybe it was in the game and out of it, I can't
         remember.) I started on 'The Chase' and if you listen to the first few
         seconds of that you can hear the basis of that super-filter-echo tune
         that is so cool. I recall David Collier was sitting in the office with
         me while I was working on it. But while messing with it while everyone
         else was at lunch, I came across this cool sound. I added to it and
         added to it, and when we applied the non-sync'd filter sweep we both
         flipped out! I decided to abandon the conversion of that tune and
         simply go with the cool sounds I had stumbled upon. When the guys came
         back from lunch and listened to it they swore that there was a
         cassette deck connected somewhere and it wasn't the C64 playing it!
         Such a sound had not been heard before by any of us out of the C64. So
         I extended it and turned it into this tripping-out 11-minute piece.
         The main theme itself... I simply did my best with no drums (Rob
         Hubbard's strength). I think my strength with guitar solos helped pull
         it off. Both of those problematic games benefited from my music,
         actually, and the Ocean management were very relieved
         (understatement)." (MG)

COMMENT: "Well, a tune could only be hard to compose if I was hard-up for ideas
         at the time - if it was a conversion/arrangement of someone else's
         music it wouldn't be composition, right? 'Microprose Soccer' and

COMMENT: "The 'version 1' is a real tune, it was really like that on
         Hypersports and maybe one or two other games before Comic Bakery
         (Cyclone would have used it, for example, but it was never released by
         Ocean). The delay at 02:03.00 really is supposed to be a delay of 4
         beats." (MG)
         Because of the delay Martin mentioned at 2:03, it led a lot of people
         to believe later parts of the tune went out of synch and it was
         bugged. However, this has been confirmed as intentional. This version
         was known to have been used in Hyper Sports and Transformers.

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Ocean_Loader_2.sid
COMMENT: "'version 2' was a reworking of that tune that I did in late 1985 for
         Comic Bakery. There was actually supposed to be separate loading music
         for every game - that was my plan.  However, I was running out of time
         on projects and in the case of C.B. I simply reworked an older piece.
         After that I _really_ didn't have time to mess with it, and it stuck
         in universal use. Rambo was the only one that got its own loading
         music as part of this plan." (MG)
         This version was in use for many Ocean/Imagine games from late 1985 to
         mid 1987.

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Parallax.sid
COMMENT: Before starting on this game Galway bought Rendez-Vous (by Jean Michel
         Jarre). He listened to it daily. His CD player broke 2 weeks later and
         didn't get repaired for 2 months, during which time Martin worked on
         Parallax, without realizing that Rendez-Vous was unconsciously
         creeping into the music. He realized it only after he played the album
         again after the game was already shipped.
         "[Parallax] was 11 minutes long, certainly my longest at the time. I
         took my development gear home to work on it for a week or two. I just
         said to myself 'OK, it's going to be this mega-tune, so the intro has
         to be mega'. The intro took up two-thirds of the tune! I actually got
         bored with it, and stuck that silly melody on the end which doesn't
         really match. Going back I would have made it less melodic. I wanted
         to reflect the gigantic visual proportions represented by the parallax
         effect in the game so that's why it has an 'epic' feel."(MG)

         on holiday the next day or something. (Was it around September-1987?)
         The arcade game didn't have any music on the 'press start' screen, so
         it would have been a natural for an original tune. Maybe everyone
         regarded it as a 'baby game' which didn't merit much attention. CAN'T

         simple ballad melody 'come and follow me', which I was able to arrange
         quite successfully. The other one was a nightmare since it's the tune
         right from the beginning of the movie with all the robotic short notes
         & arpeggios. The tune just built up so massive that the poor C64 was
         short of notes by about 30 seconds into it, so I had to fudge the end

COMMENT: "The game was re-assigned in early 1986 to Comic Bakery's programmer
         Colin Gresty and artist Steve Wahid, and they enthusiastically got
         to work on it, coming up with an all-new approach with nicer
         graphics - more like the early Grand Theft Auto games (top-down viewed
         from a chase camera).  However it was very slow going for those guys
         and while the art/design was done by mid-1987, Colin was still
         finishing the programming towards the end of that year, say, about
         September.  Ocean, who'd been advertising the game in magazines for
         months, were very annoyed by this delay and were not going to make
         their intended profit. (Perhaps their option window to publish the
         game was expiring too, who knows?) So they cancelled the project when
         it was at the 99%-complete stage and fired Colin." (MG)

         sitting comfortably?  The fact that there are two versions of
         Streethawk music is part of the whole mystery of Streethawk, really.
         It started in 1985 and was programmed by Mike Webb, who'd just come
         off Amstrad Kong Strikes Back. Lateral thinker that he is, he had a
         rather unique design going (a sideways scrolling platform-jumping
         design which is probably now lost forever), and I think he went on
         holiday for a week or two, and when he came back they decided to have
         him do another project - or, he left to join forces with Richard Kay

         Neverending Story.  There was no filter technology in my driver. All
         that Ocean had as reference for the show was an NTSC tape of the pilot

         the end of course. I was starting to face the glass ceiling imposed by
         the filter on the C64. While my particular SID sounded great, others
         were not like it at all and the solos were almost inaudible! At the
         other extreme the new C64C's were coming out and this filter
         unreliability had been fixed as part of a silicon revision. BUT the
         filters were way too open all the time and you could hardly hear any
         filtering! This caused the filtered note to come out a lot louder than
         it should have and 'stick out' rather unattractively. So I developed a
         'filter adjustment' parameter for my music program which would allow
         the customer to control this filter unreliability and get their
         particular machine to sound cool. But David Collier never put it in

COMMENT: "One of the first machine language based songs I made on the C-64.
         'Soundcontrol' didn't have any fancy features at this time, so the
         songs aren't the greatest. Btw, I thought this game had never been
         released (since I never got any royalties)." (HG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Gehrmann_Holger/Hollywood_Poker.sid
COMMENT: "I think this was the first song with the enhanced version of
         'Soundcontrol'. Now it was a sound programming language (SOPROL) where
         you could type in your songs like a basic program (with labels, sound
         commands and so on), and a compiler converted it to machine language.
         Unfortunately the compiled songs were running VERY slow because of the
         structure of the SOPROL language." (HG)
         Holger Gehrmann also did the music for the Amiga version of the game
         which shares the same melody.

/MUSICIANS/G/Gehrmann_Holger/Input_64_Issue_03_85.sid
COMMENT: "For about 6 months I worked at Heise Verlag, and they had a radio
         commercial and wanted it to be converted to the C-64.
         I didn't have an assembler at that time, so I did it with a machine
         language monitor (same as with Galactic Meteors and AOP)." (HG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Gehrmann_Holger/North-Sea_Inferno.sid
COMMENT: "Magic Bytes asked me if I could help them with the game because the

         Atari ST and Amiga version and did the C64 soundtrack. Btw, the
         programmers from Denmark released the game too, it was called 'Persian
         Gulf Inferno'. Magic Bytes sued them for doing this." (HG)

         written in a text editor and then compiled and maybe processed
         using one or several utilities. Anyway, I thought it was cool and
         decided to make my own version of it." (LG)

COMMENT: This is the sequel to Stormlord. Apparently, there was some sort of

         this game. Other versions can be found in the following directories:
         Bjerregaard_Johannes, Laxity, and Link.
         "In 1990, I produced Deliverance: Stormlord II, my last ever SID track.
         Ironically, it was for Hewson Consultants, who folded soon after. It
         was time for a change, and by then I was starting to release dance
         music for club play. It's an alright piece of work, though I think the
         sounds were probably better than some of the tunes. I've just reworked
         it for a Kickstarter project and it sounds so much better now." (MDG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Driller.sid
COMMENT: "Driller, which I did for Incentive Software, was another big turning
         point for me. They wanted something long and epic, not short and
         repetitive. Concept-wise, it was the perfect game for me. It was
         exactly the sort of thing I had been waiting to get my teeth into
         musically. It took four weeks to complete, including an almost
         two-week pause in the middle when the Great Storm of 1987 struck the
         UK, leaving us without electricity or heating for about ten or eleven
         days. I can remember walking down our road one dark evening, wondering
         if I would ever get to use the C64 again, and suddenly noticing all the
         neighbours' lights were finally on again. I went straight in, fired up
         the assembler and carried on composing." (MDG)
(#1)
COMMENT: This is how the game plays the tune, much faster than intended.
         In the game the tune was synced up to the Keyboard interrupts, speeding
         it up and making it two minutes shorter.

COMMENT: "I enjoyed doing KGB Superspy for Codemasters, as I was trying a few
         new tricks, trying to maximise any rhythm elements without using a
         whole channel to do it. The high score theme is actually a straight
         cover of the victory theme from Escape To Victory, which is a football
         version of The Great Escape. It's a film that my mates and I used to
         enjoy as kids because of the many football stars in it, including Pelé
         and Ardiles." (MDG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Last_Ninja_2.sid
COMMENT: "In 1988, as mentioned, I did The Last Ninja 2 for System 3. I did the
         Central Park tracks first, which was important in order to stamp some
         sort of "sound" on the game. It basically took from mid-January until
         early April to finish. It's about as big a project as you would want to
         undertake, but everything just seemed to work without any real hitches.
         I was given a fairly free hand to produce what I thought would be most
         suitable and luckily, every time I took in new tracks for each level, I
         got the thumbs up. It was a great time for me personally, to suddenly
         be working full time on C64 music. I was almost 18, but I had no real
         worries in the world beyond whether I could afford to buy a better car.
         I think the entire The Last Ninja 2 soundtrack is my proudest
         achievement, especially the Central Park tracks, as they seem to mean
         so much to so many people. The project itself was a pleasure to be part
         of. The whole team involved were probably at the top of their C64 game
         at the time, from John's programming to Hugh's fantastic graphics,
         Tim's storyboarding and of course Mark's overall vision and commitment.
         It's amazing that we're still talking about it nearly 30 years on."

         It has since taken on a life of its own on the demo scene, though
         apparently, not many people knew it was one of mine." (MDG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Quedex.sid
COMMENT: "Paul Docherty and/or Graham Hunter passed one of my CNet demos on to
         Paul Cooper at Thalamus. They wanted to use it for the loading
         sequence, but it had been written on Soundmonitor. Somehow, they
         managed to get it to play while the game loaded. The in-game tunes
         needed to be written in such a way that if a sound effect played,
         it didn't destroy the music too much. Stavros Fasoulas and Paul Cooper
         drove up to my parents' house where I basically had the top floor of
         a bungalow to myself. Stavros loaded up his game demos and went
         through what was needed. I think it took me about two weeks to do all
         the tunes and FX. Working for such a big name in the industry
         definitely opened up more doors." (MDG)

         in 12ths with a heavy swing. I liked the arpeggio chords in it. I also
         like the high score tune, for some reason. I later converted these to

         heard Rob Hubbard create a sound like crickets in the grass or jungle
         on Flash Gordon, so I created a similar sound which was great for the
         general atmosphere on Tusker. The drums and rhythms were also very
         important in this game. There needed to be a tribal sound overall, and
         I think I managed that. I think I spent about four or five weeks on
         this game." (MDG)

         was a cover of Infected by The The. Paul Docherty introduced me to it
         as a reference, but I took it a little too literally. I had to make a
         lot of use of the filters on this game, to keep the mood. This was
         actually my last game for System 3, sometime around March 1989. I
         think the Maniacs of Noise had rolled into town by then!" (MDG)

         release "quality-sounds".  Before ALD I was the founder member of
         Contex.  All tunes were composed with an assembler." (AH)

/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/ATA.sid
COMMENT: "Released in 1992, made with ALD-player v3.0 which was developed late
         1990. The routine turned out to be the one I used most, though v3.7
         was even ready at the time.
         The tune itself was the first one I was asked to do for a game. ATA
         was a Tetris-clone done by German Lower Level and I don't recall if I
         got paid for the track, but anyway it was liked by the authors and
         apparently many others.
         This must have been the best track I've done if I don't take count on
         my new tunes. I wasn't anymore much into composing that time, I just
         composed as a time-killer. Also a high score track was included." (AH)

 ARTIST: Marius Constant
COMMENT: "My first 'good' song with ALD-player v2.1 and one of the few covers I
         ever did. V2.1 didn't have any pulse data for $41 sounds so therefore
         I just used $11 or $21 to have acceptable melody-sounds.
         I was just playing around with the routine and somehow the Zone-theme
         appeared into my mind, but it's only influenced by the theme and the
         rest of the tune was just an effort of imagination.
         Done in January/February 1990." (AH)

/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/B-Ball.sid

         much as I sent it to my old pals, which I even didn't know if they
         were in the scene anymore or not. The B-Ball track however, never got
         released as the game wasn't sold (I guess). I liked this track a lot
         myself and in fact it was the first time I had to do jingles. The
         player I used was v3.6. B-Ball was the last (finished) track I did
         until now in 1999." (AH)

COMMENT: "Done in April 1999, yes! The first C64 tune after 1992. This tune
         participated in Proxy 99 party in Finland, even though I wasn't
         present it won the C64 music competition. Some people were really
         amazed to see a track from me for a long long time. I made the basis
         for it with Fasttracker and this is the way I compose the tunes these
         days. It's not a hard job to 'convert' the into assembler if you just
         make the tunes in a 64-style." (AH)

         around with the routine. Later on I discovered that the arpeggios
         turned out to be much like in Hawkeye by Jeroen Tel. I intended to do
         a slow tune and this is what came out of my head." (AH)

         bass (LFO/LFO) and the tune was inspired by a band called Rhythmatic.

COMMENT: With the aid of the software house CRL and distributor Nu Wave,
         Mike Oldfield released this as an interactive C64 version of
         the album in 1986 accompanied by some simple 2D visual effects.
         The interactivity offered by the album/program was limited to
         controlling the speed and quantity of the visual effects, tuning
         the sound's volume and filtering, and skipping to any part of
         the album. It can be considered the first example of a commercial
         interactive computer demo or "musicdisk".

         mastered by Markus Wiederstein. In need for a loader tune Wiederstein
         chose tunes the composer gave to Digital Marketing. That's why
         Hartwig's tunes ended up in the games.

COMMENT: "[...] The Delta music loader and ingame music was Gary Liddon's idea.
         [...] He was the producer at Thalamus at the time. He told Rob Hubbard
         to make the ingame music like the 2nd track from Dark Side of the Moon
         by Pink Floyd." (Info from Matt Furniss.)
         "The small jingles are all small clips from Sanxion and Romeo/Juliet
         music. They were all supposed to be for short stingers such as end of
         level, extra life etc..."
         "Delta was based on this minimalist composition technique inspired by
         Glass and a bit of Pink Floyd. It was quite hard to do and required
         some custom code to the driver to do it. The music was tedious to
         debug. The other Delta stuff was more conventional - I quite liked the
         other tunes. Delta was spread over a 2 week period....." (RH)
         According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most complicated one
         to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both drove him
         insane.

         some of the feel of the game, evolution etc... One of the tunes was
         also used for an ST game (GoldRunner I think). I only used 2 SID
         voices for all these tunes because I used the other for SFX...... Most
         of the tunes were sketched out on a small keyboard and manuscript
         paper. I used paper to keep track of the basic ideas and arrangement,
         and I still have all the original manuscripts. A lot of the
         manuscripts are not readable because I used to work very fast and
         never updated many of the changes I made. I used to use a machine code
         monitor to edit music data and sound patch data on the file while the
         tune was playing. This allowed me to really fine tune the SID
         parameters for the music." (RH)

         The Last V8 was the first game released by Mastertronic's new label
         MAD (Mastertronic's Added Dimension). Due to the fact they wanted the
         launch to coincide with the release of the Last V8, the game was rush
         released and therefore unfortunately had a bug, where the
         main theme music (subtune #1) falls out of synch at around the one
         minute mark.  Upon closer investigation, this is due to a mere seven
         bytes of the music player code being incorrect.  This SID has those
         bytes corrected.

         being rather good - it eventually came out in June 1988. Also, copies

/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Thrust.sid
COMMENT: Review copies of this game had a bugged loader which mucked up the
         music and so reviewers of the game gave the music a much lower rating.
         Julian Rignall (ex-editor of Zzap! 64) takes up the story:
         "I remember the God awful cacophony that was our review copy of
         Thrust's music as though it were still playing. This was the problem:
         the drum sounds worked, but all the other instrument sounds were
         screwed - basically it resulted in this horrible screeching noise
         playing to drums, rather than the cool heavyish sound that was heard
         in the final version of the game. It sounded really harsh and so it
         was duly shot down by us in the review. I remember hearing the
         'proper' version of the game at a later dater and thinking 'ooooops!'.
         After all it was a classic tune (it became one of my faves, indeed)
         and we'd mercilessly beaten it down in the review, which was totally
         unfair. Still, it was good to be able to do a ZZAPback on it and
         remedy the error."

  TITLE: Passion (0:44)
 ARTIST: The Flirts
COMMENT: This is claimed to be the first ever C64 music made using samples.
         According to Hülsbeck, though, the game "Bad Cat" was delayed about 3
         months at Rainbow Arts during which time Imagine released their game
         "Arkanoid", containing Martin Galway's sample-like technique.
         "Arkanoid" thus became the first publically available game to feature
         SID music with samples.
         This is a cover from The Flirts's song Passion. The cover starts at
         0:44 with the same bass. At 1:14 you will hear the melody from
         Passion.

         hated R'n'R. Therefore, Ramiro composed part of the Circus Attractions

/MUSICIANS/H/Huelsbeck_Chris/R-Type.sid
COMMENT: Very interesting story here. Katakis was released in September 1988 by
         Rainbow Arts, however it never got a release in the UK as Activision
         had it cancelled because of similarities to R-Type, to which
         Activision had bought the conversion rights. Activision were getting
         nowhere with their conversion of R-Type and they liked what they saw
         of Katakis, so they hired the same programming team (Manfred Trenz and
         others) to do the C64 conversion. They only got 6 weeks to write the
         conversion, and sadly, it shows. Katakis was eventually altered and
         released as Denaris in 1989. Tunes #2 to #14 all cover of the arcade
         game.

         much that he put his very own credits on the game...
         (Ed.) The game is named Stack Up (1991 by Zeppelin Games) and the guy
         is Gerard 'Gez' Gourley/Sonic Graffity.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Double_speed.sid
COMMENT: This is the only quickspeed tune not made in v17.Q0. It was made in
         1989, some time before Jeroen Tel made his first quatro-tune for
         "Invest". However, the idea was not new at that time. In the
         mid-eighties Tony Crowther experimented with quatro players in games
         such as "Zig Zag". My double speed tune, however, used the ordinary v9
         player and was simply called twice a frame.

COMMENT: Notice how I put real synthesizer chords into the digi voice. That was
         not done very often on the Commodore 64 - musicians normally used this
         channel for bass and drums only. The tune makes extensive use of ring
         modulation effects and was used in a "Pretzel Logic" demo.

         introduction changes at 01:19 to a part which was played by the clown

         for a "Boulder Dash" clone, but the Danish software house "The New

         ...this is how it was changed to make SilverRock happy. As you can
         hear, the difference is really not that big. Later on during the
         programming of the game, Thomas (the programmer) realized that he
         could not fit all the leveltunes into the game, hence this leveltune
         was the first to go.
         Composed in JCH player v17.

         Composed in JCH player v11, tune length is 0:30.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Hawaii.sid
COMMENT: A very long tune containing one of the longest solo parts I have ever
         done in a C64 tune. The bassline and drums were originally made by
         Morten Sigaard Kristensen, but in the end I "raped" it so much that it
         virtually became my own work. The solo part starts at 01:39. Notice
         how the tune decays in the end - this was very unusual on the C64.
         Composed in JCH player v15.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Heavy_Hit.sid
COMMENT: Short, "end-of-level-monster"-like tune made in a compromise player

         Composed in JCH player v19, tune length is 1:01.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Hexagon_Party.sid
COMMENT: Made FOR that party, not AT it. The tune contains quite a lot of
         harmonic mistakes, something I often made in that period. These were
         often caused by "lazy" transpositions of the bassline sequence -
         instead of creating a new one.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Labyrint.sid
COMMENT: A television quiz program which was made popular by a great Danish
         former disc-jockey Kim Schumacher was converted by a small Danish firm
         as a C64 game. The music was composed on the Amiga by an unknown guy.
         "DRAX" was asked to convert the tune for a certain sum of money but,
         as he said himself, he wasn't sure he could convert it so he asked me
         for help. I completed the conversion for the ridiculous sum of money.
         Later, "DRAX" admitted that he didn't complete the conversion because
         he thought the original Amiga music was boring. I must confess that he
         has a point there.
         Tune length is 2:09.

COMMENT: The second tune I did after "Better late than never". Most samples
         were sampled from the Korg M1 using Commodore's own hardware sampler
         which plugged into the cartridge port. It makes VERY extensive use of
         ring modulation and hard sync.

COMMENT: I was impressed with the titletune on "Maniac Mansion", an adventure
         game by LucasFilm (that was years before they changed their name to
         LucasArts). However, the instruments were rubbish so I did my very own
         version of it. At a silent part in the end of the tune I even added a
         few notes of my own.

         extra effort out of squeezing as many chords and effects into the two

COMMENT: A tune where I tried to emulate the style of Maniacs of Noise. As the

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Shift.sid
COMMENT: A worktune that wasn't finished. Due to the fact that we have reached
         1991, my Korg M1 was a reality. This tune was totally composed on the
         keyboard first, apart from the digi voice which was added later using
         the editor alone. The digi voice doesn't appear until 01:16 - it was
         supposed to be a "surprise" tune. This was also the last digital tune
         I did - and as far as I can remember, the very last C64 tune as well.
         Composed in JCH digiplayer, tune length is 2:33.

  TITLE: Hugo Rap Theme
 ARTIST: <?>
COMMENT: A professional software house in Denmark called "SilverRock" gained a
         lot of success with "Hugo" in danish television. This troll could be
         controlled in a game using telephone buttons. A very new concept which
         soon became enormously popular. During the success of the troll, a
         real musician produced a CD containing a rap hit where Hugo was
         singing using the typical voice which was also used in the game. As
         the game was converted for sales versions from the Amiga to PC and
         C64, I did the C64 song converted from the Danish rap hit.

COMMENT: I always get mixed feelings when I play this music. The title- tune is
         long and I put a lot of work into it in april 1989, but today I can
         hear loads of harmonic errors here and there. The game was done for a
         sideways shoot'em up which a couple of totally unknown danish guys was
         making. They soon lost all interest in their game, however. The
         hiscore theme was a conversion of the old Cliff Richard hit
         "Congratulations" done right out my head. I always wanted to make such
         a hiscore tune, because I always thought Rob Hubbard did it all wrong
         when he made "sad" hiscore tunes. It is a sad thing when the game
         ends, but getting a high score is supposed to be a GOOD thing! :)

         the result was not too brilliant.
         Composed in old JCH player 6.4, tune length is 2:56.

         Composed in old JCH player, tune length is 1:12.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Non_JCH_Newplayer/Quick_Blast.sid
COMMENT: One of the better tunes in the period with the old player system. It
         was also the first tune to contain the typical "Hubbard"-snare which
         was a mixture of noise and triangle, swapped at each frame.
         Composed in old JCH player, tune length is 3:32.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Non_JCH_Newplayer/Typhus_1.sid
COMMENT: This is the only tune I did in Future Composer, made at the Dexion
         copy-party in 1988, the same party where I was told by Laxity to keep
         my hands off his player. The Future Composer was a hack editor on
         Charles Deenen's player and it arrived at this party for the first
         time. I tried it out once - and never touched it again. "Typhus" was
         the name of the german guy who also ordered the "Sharks" music in the
         old player.
         Composed in Future Composer, tune length is 0:46.

         set, we (Sidder & me) did the first minute, and then Jammer came
         from nowhere and slapped his part at the end of it. Unfortunately,
         we forgot to test the tune on a real machine - and it was crucial,
         because strange filter settings make this one sound COMPLETELY
         BROKEN on C64. The title appears to fit perfectly in this case, I
         think. No wonder it was voted that low: 17th out of 19 at North
         Party 8 in 2003. So, use SIDPlay2/w." (comment by Smalltown Boy)

         rate.  But I *do* like working with the sounds at these sort of update
         rates, so I'm working on a player which takes a smaller amount of
         raster time than TFX to use for such music. (That said, one of PCH's

         She doesn't understand the 'c64 thing'. I always wanted to be able to
         write funk tunes like Drax, and later Mitch&Dane, do, and despite it
         coming almost dead last in the c64.sk sid competition, I think I
         succeeded somewhat.  I actually like a lot of the harmonic work in
         this song, as did my sister, who yelled at me after she first heard it
         for being able to pull it off! Of course, most people disagreed with

COMMENT: "Sitting in a backpackers hostel in sydney, get a call from my
         parents, I can't come home, they've rented out my room. I've been here
         for 5 weeks now, but only finally got a laptop this day. I was feeling
         incredibly dark, having spent the last week in bed ill, I really
         wanted to go home, or failing that, I wanted someone to take a few
         minutes out of their day to see if I was still alive (okay, so I was
         feeling kind of melodramatic, lol),  This girl promised to hang out
         with me, and then cancelled or forgot every time for weeks straight,
         and I was stupid (read: thinking with my heart instead of my head)
         and didn't want to acknowlage that she was ignoring me...  I was
         losing my mind, and this music represents that.
         The full verse is "Blood, Starlight, Rain like tears, Drink from
         this, and let go the years".  I don't know who penned those words, but
         I dropped the latter half from the title because I promised said girl
         that I would.
         This music was made on an emulator (vice 1.8, and of course I had
         resid turned on :-p).  It was also one of my bigger expermients with
         filters synced from different channels to the one they're targetting.
         If it works at all on a real C64, I'd consider myself very lucky, lol,

         experiment in what happens when you mix diffrent types of Ringmod and
         Sync effects, which I like the sound of.  Sidplay1 hates it. It was
         originally intended to sound quite different from this, because the

         (intended for the WOW demo of the same name), an evolution in music,
         you know, the idea being that I've also got future composer type music
         (see TFX == future composer), and the other guys were going to do
         modern music blah blah watever, I forget the details.  Anyhow, around
         2 minutes after I sat down at the editor, it instead became something
         else (I hate it when that happens :-p), which basically amounts to an
         attempt to place what was goes through my mind at the time into sid
         form... the evolution of my soul.  I achieved that, I think, which is
         probably why almost no-one else understands it.  I personally like

         Kind of a waste, really, because the original is much better than I
         could ever hope to achieve, but it's not bad compared to all of my
         others, even if it is completly pale and lame compared to the
         original. Jazzcat mislabled this "Fields of Hades" when it was used in
         an issue of Vandalism News, but we still love him anyhow :-p." (JJ)

  TITLE: Midi Drums [from the midi module]
 ARTIST: Jaymz Julian
COMMENT: "This is the second attempt I made to do this song on the C64, and was
         in fact the song that TFX table variables were created for.  I
         originally tried to do this in sid duzz it in early 1999, but the
         number of arpeggio commands required for the places where there is
         two leads in one channel, and the blips in the drum/bass channel,
         overwelmed that editor.  So I tried in JCH v20g4, where I had managed
         to succed with Sunset Spirals, due to the ability it has to change the
         wavetable from within a song, but this too was not to be, due to the
         limitations of the editor.  So, I started writing a new editor, which
         was specifically designed to handle this situation, by splitting each
         channel into six virtual channels, and using special rules to modulate
         them together.  But this took up a lot of ram and raster time, indeed
         it too so much ram in the editor that I could only store five patterns
         at a time, so this was not to be either.  So Ray introduced me to TFX,
         and I asked him about changing the wave table from within the song,
         but he wouldn't have this, because it would confuse people, but he
         suggested a viable alternative, which is to support variables in the
         wave table, and promised to add this feature asap.  That was January
         2001, but he was too busy to implement them for the next two and a
         half years.  So I started bugging him to just give me the source and
         the bits to build it, and in November 2003,  he did.  So, I put my
         money where my mouth was, and added that feature (and a bunch of
         others which I had been wanting for a long time), and I was _finally_
         able to do a version of this that I happy with.  To anyone else but
         me, this is just another mediocre game tune, but for me it was an
         achievement." (JJ)

         seem to cover his crap version, not the arcade version.  So, my

         times before, and I finally got some documentation for it, and so now
         was the time to use it.  I had the S3M of this kicking around, and so
         I covered it to learn the editor.  The instruments suck... I never was
         good at making percussion, and unfortunantly there isn't any good ones
         around made in TFX to rip.  I also had basically zero understanding of
         how the wave tables worked when I did this, and as a result there are
         some very stupid things in there which sound terrible ;).  This
         probably should never have been released, but people liked it for
         reasons that I don't understand.
         As it turned out, the instruments sounded so crap partially because
         Ray's player was horrifically bugged, at the time.  I recompiled it
         against a later player, and it sounds a LOT better." (JJ)

COMMENT: Ryo Kawasaki's own comments are denoted (RK).
         "When the first time Commodore 64 computer hit the market in 1984, I
         rushed to buy it by paying $600 at some electronic store on 45th
         street in Manhattan. It was 8-bit with only 64KB of memory. Then I
         spent two years to write these four programs as well as unpublished
         Midi-Workstation (8-track real-time Midi recorder) all by machine
         code using SuperMon without assembler so that it runs fast and leave
         enough memory for music data. Each of these programs was sold for
         $49.95 in retail stores furnished with handsome package came with
         5-inch floppy disk and manual. In 15 years, now we can buy 1GHz PC
         for the same price as I bought my first C64. And I wonder what kind
         of computer we can buy 15 years from now by paying $600?" (RK)

         SID chip in 3 channels and a master volume to recreate the audio.
         Mainly suited for speech, but can also work on other sources. This

         disables the filter. This rip has the filter enabled.

COMMENT: "Back then in 1991, the c64 was pretty much alive for me for I had no
         money for buying an amiga... but in that time my ambitions and desires
         for making music rose! Since having no sequencer or other audio gear
         except my Roland M5, I started doing c64 sids using a program called
         AMP. It allowed to compose in a tracker-like environment, and had a
         nice interface for creating sounds. I tried to learn several techniques
         by covering Hubbard's Commando, but my best sid was a cover of Moroder's
         Midnight Express." (LMan)

         his tune just to see how I would have taken his initial idea and run
         with it myself. Anyways, I had sent disks with a load of tunes on to
         all the major software companies at the time. Firebird contacted me,
         they wanted to use Icups. I told them at the time that it was kind of
         a rip off of Bogg's Detergent, but they were quite happy to offer to
         buy it. They offered me 150 pounds, and then when someone pointed out
         again to them that it was based on Bogg's tune, they gave him half the
         money too which I was quite happy with." (BL)

         was to be published by Hewson but due to licencing disagreements with
         Firebird (Sophistry being similar to Firebird's Zolyx) the game was
         cancelled.

         folk songs, my girlfriend and I bought a couple of CDs, and found a
         little gem called Allt under himmelens fäste that we both instantly
         liked. It's a very sad song with a simple melody, supported by a
         solemn yet rhythmical accompaniment written by Mahoney. If you're a
         SID composer, you know that when you get a song stuck on your mind,
         it inevitably ends up as a SID tune. =) In this case, I've tried to
         stick to Mahoney's arrangement as far as possible." (LA)

         wanted some strange cyber stuff for his Revealed magazine (issue 4 -

         this tune, but due to the fact that Markus Müller vividly
         remembers even tiny details about it, and that Edwin van Santen
         never released any Soundmonitor tunes, it seems more likely it is in
         fact Müller's. Sadly, with Edwin van Santen having passed away, we
         may never know the complete story behind it.

         a notes book to keep some order in the mess. 20 years later this
         book became the only memory of certain songs. According to it, I
         still have 40-50 disks lurking around somewhere. This short tune

         The original sounded like an old chiptune from some SNES machine
         so SID sound is not too far from its original form, just longer.
         A couple of years later Jazzcat asked a rocking SID for a dismag
         and I expanded the original tune, using Hermit's SWMconvert tool
         that he made for SIDwizard. The title refers to PANTERA guitarist
         Dimebag Darrell who was shot dead onstage in 2005. All the riffs
         and solos reflect his style, I guess he would make something like

         So I created all the subtunes with a zero data separator part with
         a MIDI keyboard and DAW software Reaper as 3-channel MIDI, fed it
         with SWMconvert.exe and set the sounds. Instead of days the whole

COMMENT: GT2.7 "This is an older worktune that I composed on guitar around

         My 'entry composition' for Avatar was a game tunes and FX pack. The
         ingame tune needed to be slow-flow and relaxed so I dusted off this
         one. Some time later I re-created it with Goat Tracker2 and expanded
         it to 3-channels (the gametune is 2-channels) and added a second
         part including heavy riffs. It wanted to release it at
         Revision 2012 but I missed the deadline as we arrived right after
         the oldschool music compo. So, it became released a little later at
         Flashback 2012." (NP)

         this one) and also watched them live here and there :) Thanks to
         Angel of Death for sorting this out! The SID was one of the short

         make use of pulse width modification.
         For the 'zero page version' of this piece, I had cut down the player
         to almost nothing in order to get a real short file with as little
         raster time as possible. During that step, I removed the routine for
         the pulse modification and increased the detuning of voice #2 and #3

COMMENT: "This is the SID I'm most proud of. The tune was also recorded later

         "Just Good Friends". It was "covered" in 1996 by Dieter Bohlen, who
         we had sent a demo tape to, and released in 1996 as Blue System's
         single "Only With You" and on his album "Body To Body". Of course I
         was neither asked for permission nor given a profit sharing. The

         out that the girl's name wasn't Kim at all, but I didn't change the

COMMENT: "My first tune with digidrums, which I had ripped from the game
         "Danger Freak". This tune marks a turning-point in my personal
         development as a musician, putting the focus more on harmonies and
         elaborate arpeggios than trying to produce a "cool sound". From this
         tune on, I also made myself a strict rule that I FIRST finish
         composing the tune on my piano or my Casio keyboard and THEN switch
         the C128 on and start with the data input. In order to reflect this,

   NAME: Intro Tune
COMMENT: The tune falls out of synch at around 4:50, which is when the tune
         should loop. However, this is due to the music data in the game
         behaving exactly the same way. You would never get to hear this part
         of the tune in the game, as the intro would finish and load the first
         level before the music got to that point.
         "I guess I had some time pressure... I knew it would fade away
         anyhow... never thought about that fact that people in 2000 would
         listen to it with SIDPlay.... :)" (RO)
         The data has been restored in this SID, to make it loop properly,
         and is confirmed by Reyn to be correct.

COMMENT: "This was done very quick & dirty, if I remember right I've had only
         3-4 hours time to compose this track in our new developed and
         finished Reflex-Tracker, a 2 channel sampletracker. Access Denied
         sample spoken by me. The bass-drumm split was make with an Amiga 500
         and converted to my C64. Later in version v1.1 of Reflex-Tracker the
         user could do this without directly in the trakker. Funny: most of
         the time in this song I use only one digichannel, after release I
         created a remix which prooves the ability of Reflex-Tracker a little
         bit better. After winning the C64 democompo at THE PARTY'94 in
         Denmark, most of the people thought our group name is 'Access Denied'
         but it was 'Reflex' instead ;)" (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Access_Denied_remix.sid
COMMENT: "This is the remix of Access_Denied_intro.sid where I show some of the
         features of Reflex-Tracker: 2 channels of digi-sounds, faked third
         voice (drum and snare which are rendered in the bassvoice), volume,
         echoeffects and flanger. All samples by me, except the "ho ho" which
         I have sampled from the german rap song 'Edelweiß'." (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Africa_Corps.sid
COMMENT: "Interesting fact: it's a 2 channel digi music but not a
         Reflex-Tracker tune. It's a routine which allows you theoretical add
         3 SID voices. The music editor is named 'Perfect Sound 3.2'.
         Unfortunately the 2 digi voices have always the speed (and pitch) of
         the first digi voice and if you really use both voices the SID
         channels were nearly destroyed and the CPU was down...
         We used this track in the note file of our (Reflex) first trackmo
         'Cafe Odd'. Later it became a very nice practice for us to use always
         a very special notefile-soundroutine for our trackmos.

 ARTIST: Allister Brimble
COMMENT: "I listened to Allister Brimble's great song on Amiga and decided that
         this song has to be remixed to the C64. Unfortunately I don't have
         the needed amount of channels so I used a big bunch of arpeggio-lead
         & bass-splits. The patterns looks like a exploded memorydump, it was
         very hard to compose this with a durationeditor (DMC4.x). I really
         forced the lead melody between the arpeggios. The music got used in
         Access Denied trackmo-notefile with a raytraced animation and a
         layered scroller. Regarding our tradition to use some special in our
         trackmo-notefiles I tried a faked 4 speed tune, that means: normal
         doublespeed routine and additionally I called the sidroutine 2 times
         (without the filterroutine), that gives: 4speed wave and 2speed
         filter." (PVCF)

         I thought it would be a revolution, the first realtime rap on C64 and

         have composed this tune mustly to show what clear filter sounds are
         possible with this routine. It's a single speeder. Unfortunately I
         didn't know the trackmo (Breitbandkatze / Reflex) and the demo parts
         during composing. You need a new sidchip, or you will miss some
         complete channels. It's possible that this tune is the track, which I
         would do just for fun with the goal that no voices are listenable on
         a old sid chip. But I'm not sure if I realy have done this, its not
         very hard to do such things ;) (my intention: all my filtereffects
         sounds horrible on a old sid and I thought it was better to show
         listeners with old sid nothing than crap) it was the last song which
         I did on C64 after 5 years of sid composing. Since 2001 and now
         (2008) I rarely compose sidtunes with QuadraSID, one or two times per

         other people (Ron Grahnert aka Odysseus) are even bored and tried to
         get his hands on the keyboard? So we found a compromise and worked
         10 min each on DMC :) That's the result!
         Ah, one interesting thing: it's a special more and halfspeed-mix. One
         channel (arpeggio channel) is halfspeeded and the other 2 channels
         are massive multispeeded (did I mention that it was very bored at this
         party ? ;) For exact details about the routine you can simply
         watch the partydemo which was released together with BrainBeat 4,

         Giana Sisters with parachutes. Now you could use your heavy machinegun

         forward routine, so I added one in his editor.
         The samples: for track 1 I used some placeholder voices (bad man,
         sumba-he!) just to see if the spoken samples work, after some months
         of work on this game and the decision that we do not release the game
         I stopped the work and I left the samples like they were. Later I
         released the Giana 2 soundpack in Brainbeat 4, SideB." (PVCF)

         Polonus' DigiTracker.
         Most of the samples were recorded by me, the spoken "PVCF of BBP" and
         "Hamburger" was my voice. Some additional samples ("Hit it" and
         "HE!") were ripped from Jeron Tel. BBP was my first demogroup from 1992

         paper and pencil, put down all timers/parts and the first real

         own style of music but all was one song! It was a very hard work.
         After winning the C64 democompo at THE PARTY'94 in Denmark, most of

         I composed this track. The result is one of the most styled intros
         ever (I hope ;) ). I worked on this tune for about 7 months (no joke)
         The complete intro from mathematica was supposed to be the intro of
         Access Denied one year before. But it didn't got finished so we added
         the 2 channel samplepart in front of Access Denied. Zorc has worked
         very hard to keep the next deadline for Mathematica 1995  ;)

         commands in the soundpattern, Quiss (the programmer of LSD and some
         of the trackmoparts in Mathematica) have included a fallback routine
         in the demo, that waits 10 sec if the floppydrive of the user is to
         slow and a trigger was missed. Unfortunately he forgot to tell me that
         the first numeric trigger he was expecting was a "0". But I began the
         count with "1" ... so 10 sec failbackpause is in all versions of
         mathematica, right before the Doom-part. Funny thing: exact 5.34 min
         long was the centerpart, I composed exact 5.34 min :)  but I don't
         know about the 10 sec fall back routine, and Quiss didn't tell me...
         he simply took notice that the music was too "short", removed the
         stop-bytes at the end of the LSD track and was satisfied. Watching
         the trackmo first time and live at THE PARTY'95 I was pissed of as
         I saw/heard the result: the music wild remixed itself after 5.34
         unless the last part was finished. I learned one thing:
         (its true up to now, 2008!!) programmers don't have any savvy about
         music.  Last funny thing: I asked all people around me what they
         thought about this crazy and disharmonic music?  All(!) comments
         sounded like this: "If PVCF compose like this it has to be like
         this" ... aha.. ha ..ha... Funny thing: after the democompetition
         the organizers have shown this trackmo again, in this time (1995)
         Mathematica was like a revolution on C64 in design & code and I
         put in at 1:36 a little irish sounding melody which forced some
         people with hooked arms to dance together on tables, I was very

         3-5 minutes, ... save !!!!
         I worked on Megasweet a whole day and I swear, it was twice as good
         as what you can hear now. But after about 8 hours of composing on my
         C64 (it was a sunny day, I ought to learn for my A-level examination)
         the C64 was freezed (a DMC-crash which occured about once per year).
         After that I was so frustrated that I released this truly unfinished
         version. Check out the great mp3 conversion from DJ SKITZ. To be
         honest I have ripped out the idea for the filtered glide effect in
         the main bassline from an Amiga-mod called "Megasweet". I thought
         it would be nice to try something similar on C64 for testing purpose.
         Then I added the chord, but didn't play it as arpeggio-sound (typical
         C64), instead I played it like a triad, very slow and voila - the
         base idea of the first real trance/chill techno music on C64 was
         born. Now the "work" begun: in DMC4 doesn't exists a filtercommand
         in pattern, so I must use different filtered basses and endless
         glide-effects in bassline. It's not much fun to work like this." (PVCF)

         [It won the X'95 demo competition held in Utrecht, Netherlands]
         Quiss told me it was shown with a old sid chip 6581 and the music
         wasn't that what it should be supposed to, but the crowd was so
         impressed by the trackmo that the applause during the whole demo
         was even louder than the sound equipement. So the old sid wasn't
         that much of a problem :)
         It's a DMC music and I hate it for the 16 slots instrument
         limitation, you can hear it: the filter doesn't sweep smooth at the
         first part, they are like triggered in a mod file. :( Later I
         released this song in one of our Brainbeat music collections, but
         I forgot to relocate the song, so every one could load the tune
         directly in his DMC. The result: some very bad remixes (which uses
         this horrible filter off-set soundsystem). The party [the demo was
         released on] had a limitation in length of demos: 5 minutes. So first
         I composed the music as a 5 minutes track. Unfortunately Quiss (the
         coder of the trackmo) didn't get enough parts in time to fill up
         the 5 minutes complete. We first have planned to show during the
         whole demo a backward timer which runs from 5 min to 0 with the
         comment "We hate timelimits!!!". After Quiss told me the lack of a
         needed last part I shortened the music drastically. I have done this
         track on a new sidchip, KB/TOM (now farbrausch) later converted
         this song for the old sidchip and released a "old sid chip" version

         fitting to the parts. It's an unusual multispeed setup: the first
         channel is singlespeed, the second double and the third something
         around 4-6, don't know anymore. It was only possible with our new NMI

         of my musics in his trackmos than we could in Reflex ;) Ah, AEG, if
         you care (and if you read this) : I've really planned in 1992(?)
         (after your first demo (bei nebenwirkungen essen sie die
         packungsbeilage...)) to ask you if I could join Smash Designs, no
         joke! But in those times my musics were so bad that I waited and then
         I got an offer from Reflex." (PVCF)

COMMENT: "This tune is 100% by me, but I made this zak for a competition where
         the musician have to be there to compete. So I gave the tune to CDAW
         and he competed with this track in the competition under his handle.
         The credits for CDAW are false. It's my tune but the player on the
         compo which are released with the song shows his name. Songcollection
         'Brainbeat 1', which surely have included the song (ed: in the note)
         should credit me." (PVCF)

         full of this tune - it was used in nearly all notes on the disk

         version, since I had an 800XE before C64. Anyway the C64 version is

         "As you may know I have been sleeping 25 f*cking years, doing
         nothing.... :) it was just amazing to notice that the memory remains
         and especially this scene c64 still alive and actually seems to be
         boiling ! I want to thank Lemming for updating my c64 HW, and giving
         me a chance to make this happen again. So without Lemming ( and some
         beers ) this would not have never happened. Thanks Lemming!" (SS)

         rock started one piece with we-music editor. but he didn't finish it..
         A  few weeks ago I found it on rock's work disk, and I decided to

         of free memory, so I had to chuck out all the effects modules in my
         music player to make room for the data (even vibrato had to go). The
         result was some rather flat sounding tunes!" (AR)

COMMENT: "Some of the tunes that Steve did were certainly very inspired by
         music they were listening to at the time. Generally speaking, Steve
         was usually inspired by a riff or beat or bassline; when we went
         clubbing, you would occasionally see him staring off into space trying
         to pick apart a tune and memorize it." (comment by Andrew Roberts)

COMMENT: Tapeloader tune in Retrograde is slightly different from the disk
         version found in /MUSICIANS/R/Rowlands_Steve/Retrograde.sid, Tune #2.
         "The disk version was the original version of this tune. While
         mastering the game, the cassette loader would always hang at the
         "pause" in the music (the point where everything stops for a moment,
         listen for this at 1:31). They tracked this down to the pause in the
         music and thus the cassette loader uses a slightly different tune
         which doesn't stop." (Comment by Andrew Roberts)

/MUSICIANS/S/SIDwave/Mixed_Emotions.sid
COMMENT: "That's exactly what my emotions were as I used this tune in my last
         demo, on the last screen. It was the Dexion-party in 1988. I had
         released 'Apolloguys' the same day, and I had bought my Amiga 500 only
         2 weeks before coming to this party. The first screen featured 'Like
         Galway', and me writing a lot of text about who and what 'rambones'
         was. The middle screen was the 'Amiga Noid' screen, with a small
         picture of an Amiga, and a scroll telling that TST would soon rule it.
         The last one, with this music, was a 10 point list of things about the
         C64 that bored the hell out of me. Things like colorbars, sprites
         moving in sinus, Hubbard alike drums/routines, all with the same sound
         and generally everything that was in at that time. For me it was sad

         day long. My newfound inspiration: SLL .. :) After having made my
         first few Soundtracker-modules, I sent a demo with some musics and a
         picture to Hewson. They replied: your music is quite good, but we
         cannot accept you as a graphics-artist, the picture lacks all kind of

         One of my good contacts, and a very musical one to was Banana/The

         first laid my hands on Soundmon. I didn't know at all how to use this
         program, but I could hear from Chris' and Banana's music that it
         definately was the way to go. So I asked Banana for some help. He sent
         me about 10 handwritten pages, how to type in this bass and use

         Soundmonitor, and, not to my surprise, of course he was much better
         than I. So, what do you do ? Of course, another 'Ode to...' :) I kinda
         like this, as did he, but there's hardly any bass in it, because I try

         friends in the crew. I deleted it after the meeting, as it
         was pure crap. 15 years later Jerry/Triad got hold of this
         disk and played around a little, and managed to undelete the
         file I had forgotten over the years that passed. I decided to
         release it just for fun! If it hurts your ears, don't blame
         me, blame Jerry for undeleting it in the first place! :)" (PS)

COMMENT: "As we were not in the mood for composing anything serious during
         our meeting in December 2003, Sidder had the idea to come up with a
         parody of Murdock's style. It took last place in the Forever 2004
         music compo and I have to say it was quite disappointing - either we
         failed to recreate the style correctly or it's not as attractive as
         we thought :)" (comment by Smalltown Boy)

COMMENT: "All these tunes were written in 1990 for my design group by a
         friend called Arkadiusz 'Smart Monkey' Zych. They leaked from another
         friend of mine, Pawel 'Polonus' Soltysinski, who received them from
         me in 1991. Polonus was a member of Padua at the time. Neither me nor
         Arkadiusz was informed about them being used in C64 productions.
         Some of those compositions - orginally written for SID - were later
         used by Arkadiusz in his commercial, non-computer related ventures"

         just seeing what you could do with a few basic sequences by mixing and
         transposing them. At the time I didn't really like 'acid' music, I was
         more likely to listen to John Cage or Pierre Henry, so I wasn't really
         sure how to write it. SoedeSoft editor again. Horrible drums again,

         get a ring-mod effect that sounded like an electric guitar being left
         leaning on a Marshall amplifier turned up to 11. I was fairly pleased
         with the result, it sounds quite uncomfortable on headphones. The tune
         was written on a SoedeSoft editor, which explains the rather fuzzy
         triggering and messy drum sounds, but gliding and filter control was
         much more versatile than anything else around at the time, I felt, and
         you could sustain notes for about 5 hours. The tune was not written
         especially for the "Acid At The PC Show" demo, having being composed
         around 8 weeks earlier, but Shane (coder) wanted to use them." (BH)

         in London (hence the demo title). Has a long ending after a drum solo
         that John Bonham would probably laugh at. I also did a version of this
         tune in Ubiks Music in 1988, which was even worse. I hope that's never

         meant to be released but we ended up sticking in on an SG demo disk
         anyway. Note that one of the arpeggios is a bit wonky, and I couldn't
         be bothered to do the start of the piece, but I felt that it was a
         pretty good sound-a-like." (BH)

COMMENT: "Another day, another pointless budget game. Yogi Bear deserved
         better! I can't remember if I composed the tune or if it was a
         conversion of some Atari ST music, written by some bloke who's name I
         can't remember. We used to do a few conversions back then. These were
         great fun to do. The software company would sent Gerard Gourley a copy
         of the original music, usually recorded on a cassette recorder sitting
         by the TV. He'd then play the tune down the telephone to me, and I'd
         record it on another cassette from the telephone's earpiece. The
         resulting hi-fidelity master recording would then be my basis. I
         usually had to guess at the basslines, as they'd become totally
         inaudible on the tape. Then I'd U-U the result back to Gerard within 2
         hours, and if I was lucky I'd get £100 about 6 months later after the
         'middle man' had taken his bit. Or half that if the tune was for
         Ocean." (BH)

         can't have listened to more than about 10 seconds of it. I quite liked
         it at the time, but more for the effects than the rather scrappy lead
         lines. Tune #4 was totally different in style, for the hiscore table.

         you come up with something new just to find out that someone else has
         done it 10 years ago... But sometimes strange things happen and even
         lamers like myself stumble on new stuff. This happened when we were
         working on our 4k intro Pico! for Breakpoint this year. I was coding
         the music player and tried to create some drum sounds when I
         accidentally got some harsh, very distorted sounds. The funny thing
         was that I was using the noise waveform and got something that sounded
         like a synthesized electric guitar!" (SounDemoN)

/MUSICIANS/T/Taylor_Stuart/Sky_Runner.sid
COMMENT: "I had been commissioned by Orpheus Software (ironically the makers of
         Electrosound) to code the music for their game Sky Runner. They sent
         me a work-in-progress version of the game along with a
         sort-of-completed Electrosound composition. They wanted me to
         transpose this to a non-Electrosound version and make it my own - what
         you hear on here is the end result. Unfortunately the MD of Orpheus at
         the time was a complete nightmare to work with - I was young and naive
         at the time but this was my first experience, commercially, of trying
         to get money out of someone. He just wouldn't pay - kept saying cheque
         would be in the post, give it another week or so etc etc....looking at
         Sky Runner for the first time ever (on here) it looks like the
         programmer's deal with Orpheus went pretty sour as well. I see the
         game was published by another software house (Cascade?) and the music
         had gone back to it's original Electrosound composition - obviously I
         had no dealings with Cascade - they probably didn't even know about my
         arrangement!!.... About 1 year later, under new management, Orpheus
         approached me again asking me to do some more music. OK, I said,
         firstly you pay me for Sky Runner and secondly I want the money for
         the new music (I think it was an adaption of some board game involving
         moving buses around London???) up front - they obliged so there was a
         happy ending to this story." (ST)

         Q: Is this a cover?
         JT: NO! Worldshocking huh? I could actually compose music in the
         classical traditional sence :) It's all COMPOSED by me. More people
         seemed to be wondering if I *really composed Bad Blood*. The answer is
         yes with a capital Y.
         Charles Deenen said it was the "best music I made on C64" when I
         finished it. (I do NOT agree ofcourse, although I must say it's the
         best "filmscore" soundtrack I've done for a game on the C64. I
         actually got some kind of filmscript for it, that's why I could be
         very specific when composing themes for characters and events in the
         game.

/MUSICIANS/T/Tel_Jeroen/KOUD_HE.sid
COMMENT: This tune was the original prototype for the title theme from Savage.
         Jeroen did this first, sampling the Dutch comedian Harry Vermeegen.
         'Koud he' was his catchphrase and translated it means 'Cold eh?'.
         His most notorious use of this was a Dutch TV programme called 'Pisa'
         (filmed from the leaning tower) with Harry saying his 'Koud He?'
         catchphrase to everyone that went by. Probe Software then heard the
         tune and asked Jeroen if he'd change the samples, and lo and behold it
         became the Savage theme.
         "Some background info. The 'KOUD HE' sample is from a Dutch comedian
         called 'Harry Vermeegen'. It was like a hype saying. I found it a nice
         sample to play around with. A spontanious tune I did just 4 fun." (JT)

COMMENT: " 'Nighthunter' voice is me. The 'laughing' and the 'Allright!' is ME
         and my BROTHER, just before we're about to hit town. That explain the
         silly 'BURP!' and 'AJIIRK' too. My brother was pushing me to go with
         him, so I asked him to sample some voices real fast. (in this case,
         rather silly ones.) This is probably the most 'rushed' music I've ever
         made. (which shows somehow). I like many of the ideas in it, but I
         just had to meet the deadline. No time for quality checks... just...
         PRODUCE and DELIVER. Too bad somehow. It give us a funny compilation
         of brainactivity though :O
         BTW: If you want to know my brother's name: It's 'Kees Tel' (he's an
         awesome composer and musician. He composes almost any imaginable style
         of music and plays a LOT of instruments.)" (All comments by JT.)

         EUROPE was never finished (at least not the first version). I don't
         know why/when/where/how.
         Then Turbo Outrun was made. (you know the music, etc.) One of the two
         title-tunes (not the 1.2.3. hit-it! one) was actually composed for
         Outrun Europe.
         OUTRUN EUROPA in 1990 is a totally different game from the old

COMMENT: Most of the tunes are heavily inspired by the music in the arcade
         game.
         "Turbo Outrun took about a month all together. It was a lot of fun,
         but I recomposed every tune about three times to get it perfect. I
         still think it is one of the best audio tracks I ever did on the C64."
         "One nice, very nice note: 'Turbo Outrun' (the music) has won the:
         'Best music on 8bit computer 1989' award (at the PCW show (now ECTS)
         in London. :D Too bad I had to find out later. US Gold received the
         actual award. Bastards! I wasn't even at the scene when it was
         presented. :( " (JT)

         the music for Circus Attractions while Ramiro had the pleasure of
         doing Rock'n'Roll. Now Chris hated circus music as much as Ramiro
         hated R'n'R. Therefore, Ramiro composed part of the Circus Attractions
         title music [and] Chris at some stage helped Ramiro with the R'n'R

         it had bugs. Soci fixed it to 2x speed and at the competition the tune

COMMENT: "Walker's Warbles" was a Martin Walker music demo which came as a free
         giveaway with the disk version of "Armalyte" by Thalamus (which MW did
         the music for.) Tune #3 is an early version of what would eventually be
         used in the game "Dominion" bundled on a Zzap! 64 covertape in 1990,
         and tune #4 is an early version of the "Aggressor Theme". The final
         version of this (and the one which Revolution uses) is the one on MW's
         "Zzap! 64 Music Demo" which appeared on Zzap 64's June 1989 covermount
         cassette. (Comment by Warren Pilkington)
(#4)
COMMENT: This tune was also used in a game called Revolution (written by Simon
         Pick). The game was never released, but featured on Commodore Format
         magazine's powerpack (tape) number one.

         "Zaw Productions" was my own C64 music group which I formed on my 19th
         birthday, 10th May 1991.  I kept it going and made various C64 tunes
         and music demos until December 1999 when I was asked if I'd like to
         join Padua.  I was more than happy to, so I ceased Zaw Productions at
         the same time." (WP)

COMMENT: "I've seen She Makes War three times live in the last year
         or so and really like her music.  The original is the opening
         track the album and one which sets the mood rather nicely, and
         lended itself well to get a pretty accurate conversion of the
         song. Well worth checking out her music in my view." (WP)

         suited the brief too.  Unbelievably I composed the whole tune

         Rowlands used to use this technique called "noteplexing" to make the
         C64 sound like it had more channels.  Well, I just _had_ to give it a
         go, and at one point there does sound like five channels at once,
         which wasn't bad.  It was bloody messy to get right, though!" (WP)

         I had an idea in my head to make the C64 sound like those annoying as

         Unfortunately I could only achieve this with combined waveform $61 on
         the 6581, so the 8580 will play this wrong - in fact, you really need
         a real C64 or HardSID to hear it as I intended it.  See if you can

         "I've always been a big fan of Cabaret Voltaire, and the 12" version
         of Sensoria is right up there with my favourites.  I'd tried to do
         a version of it back in 2009, but didn't get beyond the first 30
         seconds or so.  It was good to go back and start from scratch, and
         concentrate first on getting the basslines right, and from there
         build the tune up.  It also plays a little bit faster than the
         original does to keep it faster paced too.  Naturally the bass
         sounds massively better on a 6581 for which the tune was designed,
         on an 8580 it just doesn't work so well." (WP)

         type handclap chant as the main drum, and then throughout the title
         tune it was going to reference some football songs with the drum
         backing.  The disk was thought to be lost when I moved house many
         years ago, but found an unlabelled disk, and saw the file names on
         there.  When I loaded them into Ubik's Musik it was indeed this,
         so pretty good to salvage it all round.
         On the same disk as the Arsenal title tune, I'd put together a few
         sound effects which could have played when you were playing the game
         of football.  I was also considering some football chants such as

         Whittaker's permission, because the programmers of that game credited
         this tune to themselves.

  TITLE: Action Biker, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Rob Hubbard
COMMENT: "This is a remix from Rob Hubbard's Action Biker main theme (tune #1)
         from the year 1985! (C) Mastertronic. Listen to the original and hear
         the difference! I first typed over the notes (bass + lead) from a Music
         Assembler example tune. Not using the ugly percussion track. The
         chords are typed over from a Midi file called Biker. (Lazy me eh?!).
         Maybe this will not be necessary in future because there is a Midi to
         Mod program and buddy Roland Hermans has made a Mod to Sid program.
         I'm not quite happy with this tune because of the weak 2 notes
         arpeggio part (from 1:14 to 1:50). I made the volume of this arpeggio
         part a bit softer so it becomes a bit less annoying. Maybe I will
         improve this tune sometime. Same presets used as in Rolfie Title
         Remix. Typing over the notes took some amount of time (I always work
         slowly!). I used too many sequences in the 2nd track (it can only
         handle 128). So Roland Hermans "packed" several sequences into only a
         few so the player can handle them. This is the 2nd tune for mainly
         Polish based group Axelerate. Tune is played at CIA 1 Timer A (PAL)
         because we wanted another speed than a normal one. Tune has nice
         ending, don't you agree? Hope you like it!" (JW)

         want to listen to frequently perhaps even like a good 80s game sid.
         Soon I noticed I had too few good ideas myself so I used some
         "borrowed" music in this one in true Rob Hubbard style (he also covered
         a lot as you know). So some of other composer's music was the basis of
         some tunes varied with own ideas and combinations of these 2. Of course
         Roland Hermans (Neo) helped me with the technical bits." (JW)

   NAME: Intro Tune

  TITLE: Spybreak! [from Decksandrumsandrockandroll] (1:16-2:33)
 ARTIST: Propellerheads
COMMENT: "As you can hear in The War Begins I like the Matt Gray style. It's
         simple to do and still sounds great. The combination with the Matrix
         tune works well I think. Also I listened to a lot of hard rock/heavy
         metal music to get inspired. A lot of what Matt Gray did can be
         identified with this style. Using double bass plus MG drums is a good
         combination plus after that a ring modulation lead sounds nice." (JW)
(#3)
   NAME: Massive Attack
COMMENT: "Massive Attack begins with 2 tracks shooting SFX from the game
         Dominator. Then a Star Wars alike film tune. The piece after that the
         Jon Dunn's Robocop lead instrument fits and sounds so well! Some funny
         kicks and snares in different volumes. The last piece is very short 'n
         simple and still sounds good. Only a few sequences used. About 4 if I
         remember well." (JW)
(#4)
   NAME: Arduous Battle
COMMENT: "Arduous Battle is completely done by me. In a lot of places the bass
         notes are harder on the beat. In this I made a 64 version of a tune I
         composed on the Amiga with Protracker which was called Freedom. What I
         really like about this tune is the end part which was also first
         composed on the Amiga." (JW)

   NAME: The Tragic One
COMMENT: "Sniff sniff! A very melancholic beginning. Then some sort of Philip

  TITLE: Captain Future [from cartoon series Captain Future] (2:59-5:33)

COMMENT: "Another fine tune beginning to get your attention immediately! A bit
         filmesque start. Then a very nice Captain Future cover with some
         fantastic stretched arpeggios in it. The break in this part is my
         friend Roland's favourite (You know him from the PSID64 program). And
         the last part is composed by myself using some Galway  Rambo tune #5
         instruments which I made a bit harder volume wise. Oh yes the
         instrument of the arpeggios is an enhanced version of Jason Brooke's
         Bismarck arp. preset." (JW)
(#7)
   NAME: Space Explorer
COMMENT: "Space Explorer has a very mysterious intro. As you can hear Philip
         Glass is one of my favourite composers. Jam jam! Sounds very nice! The
         ending uses a technique I use whenever it suits: divide the notes over
         2 tracks and play them slightly over eachother. Always sounds very
         good!" (JW)

         Than Matt Gray meets Rob Hubbard! Technically one of the best I've
         written so far. Wooo! Wicked part from 2:02! Speed change in music
         player is handy! Bit boring end of 1st part. I got tired of writing for
         ASB. End part has it's moments. Robocop lead keeps ruling!" (JW)

COMMENT: "The demo in which this sound was spread contained the full lyrics of
         the song written in South Dutch dialect. This tune consists of a
         double lead to get a sort of echo effect. The reason why I made this
         song: In the south of Holland we celibrate Carnival each year around
         the end of February and because I live in a provence of Southern
         Holland called Limburg I decided to make one of the best Carnival
         songs on the C64! During Carnival everyone dresses up in some strange
         costume and goes into pubs to party and of course drink a lot of beer.
         The title of the song translated into English is: When the stars are
         shining up there. Written in waltz tempo. Hope you like it." (JW)

  TITLE: press fire [from the Amiga game Shadow of the Beast III]
 ARTIST: Tim Wright
COMMENT: "Of course I had to squeeze the Amiga 4 tracks in to C64's 3. But the
         tune uses 2 tracks for the part which isn't the lead or bass. How do
         you call that part anyway? (backing?) While going through old Amiga
         500 games with buddy Roland (we were looking through because we are
         planning a C64 demo consisting converted Amiga pics in FLI-Interlace)
         we stumbled upon this tune. I like it very much so I tried if I could
         rip it with my Datel Electronics' Amiga Action Replay MK III. I froze
         the game and typed in tracker. And golly yes! The cartridge found the
         tune and I saved it to disc and loaded it in my Protracker soundtool.
         Together with Roland I converted it. (He works much quicker than me).
         We are planning to do more conversions. After this conversion Roland
         made a program to convert from MOD to SID, right into my player as
         I said in Action Biker Remix STIL text. But now it even converts
         arpeggios! The presets are: bass from Psycho Pigs UXB. Flute resembles
         Amiga lead sample instrument but has a little waveform 41 tick at
         the beginning and is made by Roland. Other preset is from Henning
         Rokling's Henning_Rokling-02.sid which is used in demo Wild At Heart.
         We first made an arpeggio sound consisting of two different c notes
         but it didn't work out well. In beginning of the tune you can hear a
         build up of decay and sustain in this preset. To get this effect we
         had to make 4 presets just changing the decay and sustain from 2 to 8.
         The wave on effects on bass and Rokling preset make it sound ok on
         C64. Often this effect is used to substitute normal hi hat sounds.
         This ditty is one of my favourite tunes!" (JW)

         decided to let them out and use 2 voices for the lead. The idea to
         make this mini tune was that I coincidentally found a nice midi file
         on the net from which I only used the background. Preset of this is
         taken from Demon's Aural Manouvers II. I listened to the original TV

  TITLE: Ritmo de la Noche
 ARTIST: Mystic
COMMENT: "This is the title theme and means in English: Rhythm of the night.
         Mystic's version was based on: I go to Rio from Peter Allen and Ritmo
         de la Noche by Chocolate. It contains 5 tracks: 3 normal and 2
         separate digi tracks consisting of a drum track and some several
         chords track. Was first made with Protracker on my old and trusty
         Amiga 500." (JW)
(#2)
COMMENT: "The row of notes (not the bass or lead) is borrowed from a music I
         heard in the heroic cartoon series Prince Valiant and is used as high
         score music. It consists again a bass from Tim Follin's Psycho Pigs
         UXB tune #1. Lead is again of Jeroen Tel's Myth tune #3 this time
         without filter. Of course the old trick is used to divide the notes
         over 2 tracks." (JW)

/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/Lullaby.sid
COMMENT: "Called sleeping song because Roland thought it was a song from which
         you get very sleepy. The chords are taken from the beginning of the
         music of a Dutch USA team demo called Nemesis, I made use of some
         sawtooth presets to get that Galway feel. Bassline is simply using a C
         note and the C note an octave higher. Made in Music Assembler which
         was shortened by pally Roland Hermans, so it only occupies memory from
         $1000-$12EF on the C64 which is 3 blocks (less than 1 K!). Neil
         Baldwin's Demonic-Part_1 was an example for me, using 2 tracks for
         lead when the bass is suspended. The nicest thing of the C64 sid chip
         is that you can create a warm analogue sound." (JW)

/MUSICIANS/W/Wijnhoven_Joachim/MK_II.sid
COMMENT: "Was used in the Spanish SF adventure MK II. Music is played when the
         awesome intro pic is shown which makes it sound even better! Again the
         Matt Gray minimalistic style was used but I added some of my own ideas

COMMENT: "This is my Mekka Symposium 2001 SID competition entry. It finished
         11th from the 29 and got 32 votes. Too bad there is no independent
         jury on the Mekka party so if you know a lot of people who will vote
         for you, you will finish 1st. The first part (from 0:00 to 0:45) was
         made back in '92. The rest was made in 2 weeks in 2001. At the party
         sids are played up to 4 minutes. So I had to stop at the end of the
         4th minute. Since this msx contains a sample beat it must be played on
         an old sid, as was done on the party. You had to mention on the entry
         sheet which sid they had to use. Too bad the music was played too soft
         on the party (held during Easter). The zax might be a bit too
         long-winded. The DD III part was converted from an Amiga MOD" (JW)

         wanted to convert this tune and fortunately I found the Med files
         which saved me from very much work. 11 presets were used among a

COMMENT: "This is a remix of the title theme I made for a children's cd rom I
         am making together with some pallies of mine. The cd rom is called
         "Rolfie Op Wereldreis" which is translated: "Rolfie On A World Trip"
         and is about a cat which travels around the world visiting 10
         countries from which England and America are divided into 2 pages. So
         in total there are 12 different country drawings, a title page, a
         credits page and and end page. With every page there comes an
         appropriate, spheric music plus lyrics about what can be seen in the
         drawings. All the sight seeing objects can be seen in a picture of
         each country. For instance in Egypt you can see: some pyramids, a
         sphinx, the Nile, a palm tree, some background items and Rolfie the
         cat on a camel. When you click on an object it starts to animate and a
         WAV-file begins to play making e.g. a camel sound and telling a story
         about e.g. a camel. This title tune is apart from the melody altered
         heavily to let it sound ok on the C64. This is the first tune I made
         since 1992 which was spread, so you can call it a sort of test tune.
         And this is also the first tune made for mainly Poland based group
         Axelerate which has died in the beginning of 2001. All presets are the
         same as in Linko music except before every bass sound (from 0:15),
         there is a kick drum sound added. Idea for 3 track chords in beginning
         is from Reyn Ouwehand's Deadlock (brilliant title tune). Wind sound
         was added, as always if something needs to be added, it was done by
         pally Roland 'Neo' Hermans. Hope U like it!" (JW)

         the 1st. Thanx again to Neo for helping with the presets but in the

         in this tune. I think this is one of the best basslines I ever heard.
         It's pretty complex! Chris is/was probably the best German computer

COMMENT: "It's a long time ago that I composed sounds for the good old C64. But
         all I remember is that it was a very great time with much fun.
         My composing started in the years 1983/84 when I programmed my own
         music-editor and the music-play-routine. I made an extra-routine for
         each sound. From music to music I changed that routine to get
         different sounds. I have made some musics, good and bad sounds. But I
         have tried to make people happy with listening to my music."

         Thanks to Metal Maniac for that. The tune had actually been composed
         for Anarchy's second issue (hence the name), which has never got

 ARTIST: Jori Olkkonen (Yip)
COMMENT: Another version of Yip's tune from Scroll Machine, played using a
         simpler music routine, because the original music routine interfered
         with the game's code: "I had to ask Jori to make the music with
         slightly less sparse synching, but when I did that the sound quality
         dropped a bit. The result was a bearable compromise. The screen
         glitches were almost gone and the music still sounds fairly good."
