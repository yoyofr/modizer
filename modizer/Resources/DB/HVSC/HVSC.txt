CHAPTER [1]: Introduction
-------------------------

[1-1] Brief SID History
=======================

What exactly is a Commodore 64 (C64) SID tune?  Basically it is music
originally generated on the C64, a popular family computer from the '80s.
The C64 was undoubtedly ahead of its time offering many advanced features
for a relatively cheap price.  One particular advanced feature on the C64 was
the Sound Interface Device (SID) chip developed in 1982 by Bob Yannes.  The
remarkable capabilities of this chip caused a revolution in the computer music
industry.  The chip was so revolutionary in fact that Byte Magazine named the
chip one of the Top 20 most important chips in computing history (see Byte's
20th Anniversary tribute edition, 1996).

Although the design of the chip was quite a feat, the true test of technology
is what people can do with it.  The early musical pieces on the C64 were
impressive for that time frame, but the hidden potential of the chip
wasn't heard until 1985.  Composers began to use audio "illusions" that
tricked the ear into hearing more voices than the three-voice chip actually
had.  The music continued to progress in 1987 when musicians began to
utilize a fourth voice which was dedicated for samples.  Although many other
improvements to SID music have been made over the years, none were as
important as the two just mentioned.

More importantly, though, was the release of this technology to the C64
public world.  Back then, composers had to also program their own tools
otherwise the composers would have to create their music using primitive
software.  Due to a competitive game musician market, however, musicians were
reluctant to share their knowledge.  Through reverse-engineering and some
eventual leaks, the C64 public soon utilized some of these advanced music
tools creating a boom in the amount of quality music available.

Throughout the 1990s, the C64 game industry may have ceased to a halt, but
there are still many musicians who compose for demo groups, who still enjoy
the challenge of squeezing as much as they can out of the SID chip.  Most
of these new tunes will hold special memories for people, but in a different
way in that you'll remember them from demo X or Y rather than as a game
soundtrack.

[1-2] The HVSC Project
======================

The HVSC Project is an attempt to accurately archive the most popular C64
SIDs into one complete collection.  The project was started in May 1996
when a few ambitious people decided to merge the many SIDs collections
available on the Internet into one masterpiece.  The previous SID
collections contained many bugged SIDs, repeats, and inaccurate credits
not to mention being highly disorganised.  Thus this task was not a simple
"copy & paste" unfortunately.  An additional challenge for us dealt with
being compatible with other platforms.  The only way one true collection can
exist is if we remain compatible with the major operating systems currently
in use.

As we merged the collections we began to realize that many famous SIDs were
missing.  This led to the HVSC Crew and many others to begin searching
various C64 software archives for more SIDs to rip.  Due to this effort the
collection began to grow at an enormous rate.  As we progressed, we then
noticed that many inconsistencies and questions started to surface.  For
example, we would find a music credited to a famous composer yet the style
of the music was completely different than his normal style.  One sure way
of solving these mysteries was to contact the original composers.  Over time
we gradually tracked several of them down and received a tremendous amount of
information.  As you may have figured out, we are SID archeologists patiently
piecing together SID history with only fragments of information.

The HVSC name, incidentally, came about as part of an early agreement with
the makers of the High Voltage CDs, who made CDs full of C64 games and demos
(and one of them was actually a member of the HVSC Crew for some time.)

You may be asking yourself, "Why go through so much effort for SID music?"
Only a person who never owned a C64 would ask such a question.  Many people
long to hear these old, classic tunes that they enjoyed in their youth.
You don't believe us?  Look at the amount of Television sites that recall
many a program that as a child you treasured and how much memories you get
from that.  With SID music, this is true equally if not more so.
Thankfully with the abundance of SID emulators this is now possible.  What
was thought to be lost is now found.  Let the tears of joy proceed as you
listen to perhaps the most accurate and comprehensive computer music
collection in existence.

* SID emulators are available for many operating systems such as Linux,
  MacOS, BeOS, Atari Falcon, Windows, MSDOS, AmigaOS, OS/2, iOS, Android, etc.

  For a complete list of supported OSes with links see:

    The HVSC Page: http://www.hvsc.c64.org/

[1-3] The HVSC Philosophy
=========================

The HVSC is a free-ware collection.  As tradition with most free-ware
projects, the organisers maintain the project in their free time.  In order
to help the HVSC Crew keep their sanity, we expect everyone helping the
project to avoid burdening the maintainers with mundane tasks.  What exactly
do we mean by this?  Well, basically we expect that if anyone emails us with
comments, SIDs, questions, etc., that they have first put forth some effort
so that we do not have to ourselves.  It is all very well stating that
certain tunes were composed by a certain composer, but if you can also submit
any worthwhile information to support your statement, then we can check this
for ourselves as well.  One must realise that a tremendous and painstaking
amount of man-hours have gone into the project.  In order for the collection
to continue on, we cannot continue to put forth as much time.  Thus, we ask
that you take on some of the burden.  Don't let that word "burden" scare you
too much -- we are only talking about a small amount of work here.

Here are some general, friendly rules to keep in mind:

* Every SID you submit should follow the HVSC credit standard (see Section
  3-3).

* Verify claims you make about a SID being bugged by loading the
  original tune on a C64 _only_.   Also, if tunes are missing
  from a SID, then please let us know which ones (see the BUGLIST.txt file
  for more information.)

* Verify any credit changes you submit either with the composer himself or
  by checking the actual software for when it was released.  In addition,
  please justify any credit fixes you wish to make.

In general, the messages are VERIFY and STANDARDISE.

Unfortunately, if you do not follow these simple rules we will either ignore
the email or you will experience a long delay until the submitted changes
take place.  We hope that we are not coming across as rude, but as we have
already noted, we have spent years on this collection verifying its
correctness.  Further, we have spent many a day correcting and re-correcting
the credits of SIDs so that we can also serve as a vault of information of
SID music.  If people do not work with the same level of precision as we
would like them to do, the collection will take a regressive step.

---------------------------------
CHAPTER [2]: Collection Structure
---------------------------------

There are several ways in which most SID collections have been organised.
To name a few, by Author's first name, by categories such as demos and games,
or to have a simple rat's nest of SIDs.  We have chosen to arrange the
collection by the author's last name or by the author's alias if it was used
more frequently. Finally, we usually only give composers their own directory
when we have three or more tunes available from them.  This then makes it a
little easier for you to locate the composer.

Below are a some comments about a few special directories:

/DEMOS/X-X/ - For tunes found in demos in which the artist has less than three
              tunes.

/DEMOS/UNKNOWN - For tunes found in demos in which the artists are unknown.

/DEMOS/Commodore/ - Mainly files from the C64 manuals or test disks that came
                    along with the various drive models.

/DOCUMENTS -  If you are reading this document, then most likely you have
              already figured out what this directory is for.  It also keeps
              an archive of all the update data files and information texts.

/GAMES/X-X/ - For games first released in which the artist has less than three
              tunes.  Game tunes with unknown artists go here as well (sadly,
              many an older C64 game had no composer information and we
              usually have had to contact the programmers themselves also to
              verify)

/MUSICIANS/X-X/ - Tunes sorted by the composers names or handles (if they are
                  more widely used than their real names)

----------------------------
CHAPTER [3]: How Can I Help?
----------------------------

[3-1]: Important Note
=====================

If you have anything to contribute to the HVSC Crew, then please feel
free to contact us at any time.  To help us keep track of incoming
emails please put [HVSC] in the start of the subject line of your email,
followed by the HVSC-related topic in question.
Keep in mind we have archived more or less all emails since the start of
HVSC, and we do search that archive now and then to track back how tunes
have been modified during the HVSC history. Putting [HVSC] into the subject
line greatly simplifies these searches.

[3-2]: Contributing SIDs
========================

We love to receive new SIDs for HVSC.  Of specific interest are tunes
from games, mainly because the game tunes bring back more memories for
the people that played them and they were commercially available, but
we'll take anything you have unless the tunes are completely lacking musical
skill.  It very rarely happens that we reject tunes from inclusion into HVSC,
but we reserve the right to do so if you keep sending these one channel BASIC
rips from private games that only you and your neighbour ever had access
to.  ;-)

Don't bother ripping fresh scene releases, we usually keep an eye on it and
try to rip all the tunes as they get released into the scene.

[3-2-1]: What does the HVSC Crew want?
======================================

Here are some of the items we are looking for:

  * Complete collections directly from the composers (this is most ideal
    as they will usually have all the information we require, too).
    If you send us complete collections from yourself, your friends or
    your former groupmates, please also provide information about the
    sidmodel (6581/8580).

  * Loading/Intro tunes used in games.  These are rare since crackers
    would often not include the tunes along with the cracks.  In particular,
    cassette loading themes would often not make it in a crack (although as
    you will hear, many of them have been restored)

  * SIDs already in the HVSC, but with additional sub-tunes.
    SIDs with additional sound effects are okay, but we prefer SIDs
    with more tunes instead.  The reasoning behind this is that the extra
    tunes would have memories from the game for people (particularly any
    game complete tunes).

  * Fixes of SIDs already in HVSC.  We have found several tunes that start
    at the wrong location, have missing voices, with bad samples, etc.
    Please, wherever possible, check them on a real C64 to ensure they work.

  * Real C64-compliant rips

  - We DON'T want any Compute Gazette SID tunes.  Instead, consult here
    for a collection that does:  http://www.c64music.co.uk/

  - We DO NOT, under any circumstances, require any more tunes from Vibrants
    members _except_ MSK.  The HVSC team have all the Vibrants' SID tune
    archives from their website, and we are in constant contact with JCH and DRAX,
    and they will be sure to send us any more they may find.

  - You will notice groups of tunes where there will be a gap in order.
    These gaps usually do not mean that we are missing these tunes, but
    rather we have found them repeated elsewhere.

  - We also DO NOT want any SID collections from the Internet unless you
    are pretty certain none of the tunes are in HVSC.  HVSC will most
    likely already have all these SIDs.  If you send us collections from
    the Internet we expect you to eliminate the tunes we already have
    and make the credits adhere to the HVSC credit standard.

  - Further, we DO NOT want any C64 tune that is just one looped sample
    playing over and over again.  Unfortunately around 1987-88 there were
    a spate of sample-only tunes that had one 20 second long sample
    either playing once or infinitely.  If in any doubt, ask us first.

[3-2-2] Contributing Guidelines
===============================

If you have SIDs that you think are not in HVSC, please send them to us!
If you already have the SIDs or disk images on your PC, fine, just email
them to hvsc (sid) c64.org.
If you have them on your old disks and have no idea how to convert them over
to your PC, get in touch with us via the same email and we'll work something
out for you.
Note, to save us some work it would be great if you could adhere to the HVSC
credit standard (see below for more information).

Also, within the zip file you should have a text file in the same format
which describes the SIDs you are sending in.
If you're bombing us with more than 10 tunes, please make sure they are in
directory order per section.

Examples:

#########
ADDITIONS
#########

/HVSC_Path/HVSC_Filename.sid
(description of rip.  Please name which demo or game you ripped them from.)

Example:
/MUSICIANS/E/Ed/Only_Ones.sid
(From Mobile Art demo by Wrath Designs.)

If a composer made two or more SIDs in the same demo, you can
group them together like this:

/MUSICIANS/I/Imaic/Always_Death.sid
/MUSICIANS/I/Imaic/Chaos_on_the_Head.sid
/MUSICIANS/I/Imaic/Hard_Problem.sid
(All three tunes from "Imaic Music Collection 4", released
 by Commo Bam in 1996.  All three are 2x tunes.)

#####
FIXES
#####

/HVSC_Path/HVSC_Filename.sid
(what the fixed rip does correctly the old one doesn't.)

Example:
/MUSICIANS/X/Xayne/Funky_Stuff.sid
(Fixes /VARIOUS/S-Z/Xayne/Crest_FLI-Pic_Mover.sid.  Tunes #1 and #2 in
 that are invalid, and it should be LDA #$02, JSR init instead.)

And additionally, if you have any STIL entries for the tunes in your
ZIP file, feel free to add them in the text file under the heading:

####
STIL
####

Please refer to STIL.faq before sending in STIL entries for each pack.

Further, if you are sending STIL entries relating to SIDs already
in HVSC, please send them directly to the current STIL Administrator:

iAN CooG <hvsc (sid) c64.org>

Please also DO NOT send any attachment that is more than 1 MB without
mailing us first to let us know and that you have confirmation from us it is
okay to send.  It's good netiquette, you know.

Please mail your ZIP file of SIDs to the following address:

hvsc (sid) c64.org (it will reach two people, so you can be assured that your
                    mail will get processed)

And, if you have the data on a C64 disk, but do not have the file transfer
capabilities to transfer C64 files to your PC, also contact the people above
and we can recommend someone who may be willing to help in the conversion task.

[3-3]: SID Credits
==================

For those of you that rip, below is the standard for labelling SIDs.  The
standard should be strictly followed.  If a few rare cases pop up in which
you are unsure how to handle, just do the best you can or mail us first to
discuss the credits.  We can always advise you if need be.

Please note that of HVSC 5.2, the COPYRIGHT keyword has been replaced with
RELEASED.  This is mainly for legal reasons, as many of the games which were
published in the 1980s are not the copyright of the original software companies
anymore, but reside with the programmers.  In addition, in a lot of cases,
the composer has retained his original copyright for the piece or asked a
publisher (such as C64Audio) to do that for them.  Also, it should more
accurately state when demo tunes were either composed or released into
the C64 scene, as many of those demo composers retain the copyright of
the tunes themselves.

One important reminder: _ALL_ tunes in HVSC are strictly the copyright of the
original authors and/or software companies (if the company still exists).
Because of this, use of them at profit is subject to law.

SID emulators will eventually embrace this change, as will SID Editing tools
such as SIDedit.

   SID Credits Standard

      Here is a list of how the RELEASED year is handled for various
      cases:

      198? - tune is released in the '80s
      199? - tune is released in the '90s
   1988-89 - exact year in which tune was released is not known, but it is
             known that the tune was released in this range.
      19?? - tune was released in the 20th century.
      200? - tune was released between 2000-2009

   -------------------
   SID Credit Pointers
   -------------------
   (1) Rippers: ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PUT YOUR NAME/ALIAS IN THE SID CREDITS!

   (2) You should be at least 80% certain of the field you are guessing.
       To put incorrect credits rather than a <?> would forever ruin your
       reputation as a serious SID collector. :)  When in doubt, at least
       follow the doubtful information with a <?>.

   (3) Just because a tune uses another author's famous music routine, that
       is not enough to signify with certainty that the tune is by that
       author.  Sometimes authors lent their routine for another to use.
       Other times the routine was used without permission.  Again, please
       use <?> if not certain.

   (4) Don't make up titles (e.g., TITLE: This Tune ROCKS!).  If you are
       ripping the tune from a demo in which the music was specifically
       made for that demo, then you can use the demo's name as the title,
       together with its part or tune number (if known), provided the composer
       did not give the tune a name.  Often the first few characters of the
       tune's binary reveal the name, so please do check when ripping.

   (5) DO NOT PUT SPACES BEFORE AND AFTER THE CREDITS IN THE SID HEADER!
       (A space should not be the first character of any credit field)

   (6) Try to follow standard English capitalisation rules when inserting
       the titles into the SID fields.  Examples:

          The Way of the Exploding Fist {correct}
          The Way Of The Exploding Fist {incorrect}

       Note that if the composer intends some of words in the title to be in
       lower case, then comply with the composer's wishes (but let us know).

   (7) Normally, you should make the default tune of the SID the first tune
       you would first hear when running the game/demo.  This is either the
       cassette or disk loading theme (if there is one) or the title tune of
       the game.

   (8) We prefer to have the musician's real name in the AUTHOR field.  If
       possible, we like to have both alias and real name for demo tunes.
       The author's real name should precede his handle.
       Standard -> <AUTHOR's REAL NAME> (HANDLE)

       Examples:

          Torben Hansen (Metal)   {correct}
          Torben "Metal" Hansen   {incorrect}

       At minimum, the name that the composer used in the game/demo should
       be in the credits.  Only if there is enough room should you put
       his real name or alias.  Note also that you should not put the
       composer's group name in the AUTHOR field.  Either put such info in
       the RELEASED line or do not add the info at all.

   (9) At a minimum, make sure to get the C64 publishers in the released
       line for games.  DO NOT assume that the programming team would have
       published the game themselves.  We do have access to Zzap! 64 reviews
       indexes, various large collections of original C64 games that we check
       and double check to make sure.

  (10) The documentation that is included with SIDPlay includes a large
       quantity of information about how to get C64 tunes working with
       SID Emulators. However, please note that rips should work on a real C64.

       Please refer to chapter [3-5] Ripping SID tunes


[3-4]: Identifying Mistakes
===========================

We know that there still exists several mistakes within HVSC,
and we would appreciate any help in correcting the mistakes.
(After all, we are only humans who run this collection in our spare time.)
In addition, we also would like to have missing information in the SID
tune credits (i.e., filling in the <?>'s).  If you have some corrections
or some additional information, no matter how insignificant, let us know.

Please mail to the following address:

  hvsc (sid) c64.org


[3-4-1] Verify Your Information
===============================

Before you mail us, please verify the information you are sending
by either loading the game/demo yourself or contacting the original
composer.  We have squashed many common beliefs as to who _really_
composed several tunes.  You might be surprised to see one of your
favorite tunes now with a different author (the correct one we hope).
This is why we suggest you first verify the information you plan to
send us.

Further, we would like to mention that you should not use C64 emulators
to compare to the sound of SIDPlay or to identify mistakes with tunes in
the HVSC.  Ideally, you should play the music on a real C64
and if then you determine that the sound of the rip is not right, you have
a valid complaint.  There are few instances, however, where a C64 emulator
can be used to show that a sid tune in HVSC is a bad rip.  Such cases
would include a tune with missing samples or a tune with missing voices.

Please bear in mind that C64 emulators don't always emulate the C64's
SID filter correctly  (VICE is closest, but the filter is too powerful).

[3-4-2] Credit and Initplay Fixes
=================================

Any credit fixes you send should also be to HVSC credit standards.  This
means it is easier for the HVSC Administration to place your fixes in
the next available update.  The following standards should be used when
submitting credit fixes:

Use the # character at the start of a line to indicate your comments.

If you have more than one credit fix under the headings of CREDITS,
NAME, AUTHOR, RELEASED you can place them all with _one_ heading.

Use CREDITS when two or more of the three fields in the SID credits needs
changing:

CREDITS
# comment: state the source!
/HVSC_Path/HVSC_Filename.sid
Name
Author
Released

You can use a * to indicate that the field should remain
unchanged.  Examples:

(#1: All fields changed, with comment #)

CREDITS
# confirmed by Steve Barrett to be his
/GAMES/M-R/MagicLand_Dizzy.sid
Magic Land Dizzy
Steve Barrett
1990 Codemasters

(#2: Two fields changed, other one left intact)

CREDITS
# confirmed by Chris
/GAMES/A-F/Deneb.sid
*
Chris Ammermüller(Beat Machine)
1989 Magic Disk 64/CP Verlag

Use TITLE if you only want to change the Name field of the SID.
This will often involve renaming the SID filename (see MOVE command
later on.)  Example:

TITLE
# confirmed by Deek
/MUSICIANS/D/Deek/Main_Jingle.sid
Ooletimin'

Use AUTHOR if you need to change the Author field of the SID.
If the author is completely different from the one originally
credited, you may need to MOVE the SID to another directory (see
MOVE command)

AUTHOR
# confirmed with the original instructions..
/GAMES/M-R/Mugsys_Revenge.sid
Neil Brennan

Use RELEASED if the release date or whom released the SID requires
a change.  Quick example:

RELEASED
# reviewed in ZZap! March 1990 issue, so it can't be 1991!
/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Gremlins_2-The_New_Batch.sid
1990 Elite

Use MOVE if the CREDITS, NAME or AUTHOR fix involves a move of file
name or directory.

MOVE
/Source_HVSC_Dir/Filename.sid
/Destination_HVSC_Dir/Filename.sid

(note: you only need to use the destination filename if it's different
from the original filename.)

Examples using the credit fixes above:
MOVE
/MUSICIANS/D/Deek/Main_Jingle.sid
/MUSICIANS/D/Deek/Ooletimin.sid

/GAMES/M-R/MagicLand_Dizzy.sid
/MUSICIANS/B/Barrett_Steve/Magic_Land_Dizzy.sid

/GAMES/M-R/Mugsys_Revenge.sid
/MUSICIANS/B/Brennan_Neil/

(In the last example, the SID filename would still be Mugsys_Revenge.sid)

If you need further information on credit fixes, please consult the
Updatexx.hvs files in your DOCUMENTS dir of HVSC for further examples,
and if you require more information on the file format of the .hvs
file, feel free to email <hvsc (sid) c64.org> at any time.

As of HVSC 4.6 (Update #31) there is also a new command, INITPLAY, which
takes care of invalid init and play addresses in SID files.  Often it has
been found you can correct just these addresses to make the SID more
C64-compliant.

INITPLAY
new init address (hex), new play address (hex)

Note that 0000 in the play address means to use the interrupt handler
that is set up during the init routine (if necessary)

Some examples:

INITPLAY
/MUSICIANS/B/Brennan_Neil/Judge_Dredd.sid
F180,0000

/MUSICIANS/S/Simon_Laszlo/Animate.sid
1000,1085

[3-4-3] PSIDv2NG Fields
=======================

As of HVSC 5.0, HVSC has adopted the PSIDv2NG file format.  For more
information on the format itself, please read sections 7 through 10
of the HVSC FAQ.

The below shows you how to submit corrections to SIDs where the PSIDv2NG
fields require setting for a SID to play more accurately.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only set any of these fields if you are absolutely sure you
have the correct information! If in doubt, please ask us.

Again, like credit fixes, you can use a # to indicate your comments if
you wish to do so.

Use the FLAGS directive where two or more of the extra flags PSIDv2NG
uses (the first one could already be set by the old PSID v2 format).
The flags are, in order:

MUSPLAYER (whether a Compute! Gazette music player needed or not.  Will
           hardly ever be used for HVSC)
PLAYSID   (deprecated, PlaySID specific, always set to 0)
CLOCK     (set the video clock speed to PAL or NTSC if known)
SIDMODEL  (to set which SID chip the SID tune is preferred to be played on)

So, for example:

FLAGS
/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid
0
0
PAL
6581

This would indicate (in order) that the tune has its own player, it's C64
compatible, plays on a PAL machine with a 6581 SID chip.

You can also use * for any field that you are not setting, so the below
would also work (the first two flags in this case are already zero):

FLAGS
/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Commando.sid
*
*
PAL
6581

Use MUSPLAYER when you wish to set whether the C64 tune has its own player
(0) or it's a Compute Gazette SID tune (1)

So, for example:

MUSPLAYER
/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid
0


PLAYSID
# deprecated, don't use.


Use the CLOCK command to set the video clock speed of a SID.  Although
mostly you'll know if it was made on a PAL or NTSC C64, there are
occasions it may be unknown, or the SID tune works happily on both
formats due to some clever code in the music player.  Examples:

CLOCK
/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Hunter_Patrol.sid
PAL

/MUSICIANS/W/Warhol_Dave/Realm_of_Impossibility.sid
NTSC

# we intend to find out which one soon.
/MUSICIANS/J/Joseph_Richard/Defender_of_the_Crown.sid
UNKNOWN

# demo has PAL and NTSC compatibility
/MUSICIANS/C/Connolly_Sean/4k_Digi_Competition_Entry.sid
ANY

Use the SIDMODEL command to set which SID chip a tune should be played on.
Some composers used the 6581, some used the 8580, or they may work well
on either SID or be unknown.

Btw, any SID made up to and including 1985 _has to be 6581_.  This is
because the C64-C with 8580 SID chips in them weren't released until
late 1986.  HVSC already has those SIDs set.

Some examples:

SIDMODEL
/MUSICIANS/W/Waz/Tunnel_To_Freedom.sid
6581

/MUSICIANS/M/Merken_Vincent/Fairad.sid
8580

/MUSICIANS/A/Achmed/Crush_01.sid
UNKNOWN

/MUSICIANS/L/Leitch_Barry/Eastenders_V2.sid
ANY


[3-5] Ripping SID tunes
=======================

    Much information about ripping is provided at our Help page.
    http://hvsc.c64.org/Help/index.html

    One rasterline has exactly 63 cycles on a PAL machine.
    Hence, the total amount of cycles available
    on a PAL C64 is 63 * 312 scanlines = $4CC8
    Thus, the correct algorithm to get the CIA timer values for multispeed
    tunes (PAL timing!) would be

    ( $4CC8 / n ) - 1

    with n being the speed setting of the tune (n=2 if doublespeed, etc.)
    Subtract one from the final result because the CIA timer is counting
    backwards to zero. So if the CIA timer value is set to $2663 it actually
    counts $2664 cycles until it reaches zero. Double that and you end up at
    the original $4CC8.

    Note, ripping SIDs requires some assembly language knowledge.  Thus,
    it's not always an easy task (but it isn't always hard,
    either).  The point we are trying to make is that if you do not plan
    to rip the SID the correct way, then do not even bother ripping the
    SID.  In particular, do not cut off the end of the music data too early,
    as this often means that the SID will fall out of synch either
    in a portion of the tune, or on restart.

-------------------------------
CHAPTER [4]: Update Information
-------------------------------

The HVSC will be constantly maintained by providing zipped update files.
These updates will add new tunes to HVSC so that you will always have the
most accurate SID collection around.  To handle deletions, renaming, moving,
etc. of files, we will also provide a 'sweeper' program that upon execution
will clean up your collection for you.

 *************************************************************************
 *     It is therefore _important_ that you keep the HVSC structure and  *
 * filenames as is, otherwise the sweeper will fail to work properly.    *
 *************************************************************************

The updates will be announced at the HVSC web page as well as
other locations.  There is no set time as to when the updates will be
available.  The frequency of updates will depend on the amount of new tunes
and corrected information we receive.  The current rate of updating is every
six months or thereabouts, but as we now have 41,200+ SID files, the
likelyhood of finding more does diminish with every update.

The HVSC Page:  http://www.hvsc.c64.org/

-------------------------------
Chapter [5]: Included Documents
-------------------------------

The following lists the documents that reside with HVSC (/DOCUMENTS):

  BUGLIST.TXT   - A list of bugged SIDs in HVSC.  Hopefully you'll see
                  fewer entries after each update. (We do try and add as many
                  fixes as possible.)

  CREATORS.TXT  - Information about the HVSC Crew, creators of the collection.

  HVSC.FAQ      - Answers to frequently asked questions about the collection.
                  You should read this before emailing the HVSC creators
                  with questions.

  MUSICIANS.TXT - A list of most of the musicians who ever composed more than
                  3+ SIDs on the C64.  We would appreciate any help in
                  fixing errors in this list.  Further, we would also like to
                  know artist's real names for the sake of possibly
                  identifying other tunes by these artist.  That is, some
                  artist composed tunes under an alias as well as their real
                  name (e.g., Neil Baldwin = Demon).

  STIL.FAQ      - STIL Frequently asked questions and STIL format issues are
                  discussed in this file.  Further, a list of STIL HEROes are
                  in this file too.  Do you have what it takes to be a STIL
                  HERO?

  STIL.TXT      - A text document listing information about the SIDs in the
                  HVSC such as original composer's name,  comments from the
                  SID composers, and interesting trivia.

  UPDATExx.HVS  - A list of fixes and additions that are performed to each
                  update.  If you want to know exactly why certain SIDs were
                  replaced, this file will likely have the answer.  The xx
                  in the file name will increase sequentially as new updates
                  are released.
