# This linker script defines symbols that should be exported
# from the shared library.
# Without this script, all global symbols are exported, which:
# - makes the library about 4K bigger
# - makes the symbols accessible from the outside
# - can lead to symbol collisions with different libraries
#   (I am not sure whether this problem actually exists)
# It should be noted that the shared library can be generated
# without this script, so you can omit it if your linker does not
# understand it.
