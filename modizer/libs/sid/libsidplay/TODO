TODO <libsidplay2>:

*New Bank Switching implementation for remappable componenets <Delayed>

*Optimise reSID? <Clock, output, read, write>

*Fastforward, Rewind.  <Under test, please comment on it's performance, there
 are both Windows and Linux versions available>

*Length detection <Delayed>

*What functions are required on the interface for other applications <Suggestions please>

*MOS6510:  Remove opcodes to individual files to support optimised versions.
           I have these in asm already, but was written in BorlandC.  <Needs converting>
           This way a C functon will be used if an asm is not present.

*Possibly provide a wds sync output for stereoplayer.  These helps external players
 which support this to sync properly to the music, there are some that use
 non-real time.  Needs stereosidplayer v10.3 being ripped
 <Do not implement full wds support in libsidplay, SYNC ONLY>.  If anyone knows
 anything about the C64s stereosidplayers internals could they contact
 sidplay2@email.com

*Add 24 bit support.

*Quad sids.

*Provide a C interface to the library.

*VIC. Possibility for more support.
