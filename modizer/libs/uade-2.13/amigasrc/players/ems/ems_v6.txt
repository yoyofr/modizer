Adapted for uade / eagleplayer by Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@iki.fi>.

This player should work on a real amiga, but at least it works on uade;)

Format of the configuration file is:
1st line: mixing mode (MONO = 1 STEREO = 2 SURROUND = 3 REAL = 4 STEREO14 = 5)
2nd line: mixing rate (default 22050)
3rd line: volume boost (in range 0-8)

Default is:
2
22050
0

2 implies stereo, 22050 is mixing rate in Hz, 0 is volume boost.

If you have a fast machine you may want to use:
5
28000
0

5 implies 14-bit stereo.

Also, try volume boost values.


Note on source code:
clear text ems player source will appear once we get explicit permission to
give it's source to anyone. We have permission to give the source to anyone
who wants to port it. (permission from sean connolly)
