Known Problems:

If you are having unresolved symbol problems when linking against the
libsidplay2 libraries then you need to update Libtool.  Libtool versions
1.4b and greater are the only ones that use the installed .la files and
correctly support C++.  The .la files contain all the library dependencies
required by libsidplay2.
