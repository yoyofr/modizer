
Amusic supports two kinds of modules. The packed module and the normal
module format. The normal format is easier to code but modules are bigger
in size (often 10 times bigger!!!). Its up to you!!!



Adlib-MOD-Format: (c)23.8.1995 - 20:10:30 by Conqueror :)
-----------------
 hex  -  dec  -  function

 000h      0     name of song + nullbyte
 018h     24     name of autor + nullbyte
 030h     48     [...]  26 instruments (26*34 byte)
 3A4h    932     songlen
 3A5h    933     number of patterns-1
 3A6h    934     patterntable (128 Byte)
 426h   1062     id: "<oïQUîRoR"
 42Fh   1071     version 10h=normal module
			 11h=packed module

if the module isn't packed:

 430h   1072     all patterns (count*9*3*64 Bytes)

 END!!!


if the module is packed:


 430h   1072     table with Trax (ptncount*9*2)

- A pattern is divided into 9 tracks. Here comes a table that contains a
  number (offset) for each track saved in the file.
  This is because many tracks in the song can be identical copies of only
  one track saved in the file.

 xxxx   xxxx     number of trax  (WORD)
 xxxx+2 xxxx+2   [...] traxdatas

 END!!!



A track is written in the following manner: First comes a word that contains
the position of the track in song. (pattern*9+tracknr)
Then follows the events. One event takes 3 bytes. But empty events takes
only 1 byte ! You can distinguish real events from empty events
with the most significant bit of the first saved byte of the event.
If the bit is zero than you have a real event. But if the bit isn't zero
than you have to create some empty events in your current track. To get
the number of empty events just read the lower 7 bits of the byte.

Got it??? Hope so!!!


Here comes the format of an event:


 BYTES: x,y,z:

 xxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyzzzzzzzz
 000011122222333354444444

 0 - pitch of the event (0-12)
 1 - octave of the event (0-7)
 2 - instrumentnumber of the event (0-26)
 3 - eventcommand (0-9)
 4 - parameter of the command (0-99)

 5 - if this bit is turned on and the file is a packed module than 4 stands
     for the number of empty tracks. But you already know that!!!



Note: Read the event from the file in this direction:

	z y x     !!!!





Here comes the instrument format of the modules:

(decimal offsets)

0-22 Name
  23 Mod-Charakt.
  24 Mod-Amplit.
  25 Mod-AD
  26 Mod-SR
  27 Mod-Waveform
  28 Carr-Charakt.
  29 Carr-Amplit.
  30 Carr-AD
  31 Carr-SR
  32 Carr-Waveform
  33 Conntect
