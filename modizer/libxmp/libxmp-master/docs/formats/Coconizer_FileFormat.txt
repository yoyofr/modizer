 ?00  :  Number of used Voices (must be either 4 or 8)
         Bit 7 set => File is a Trackfile (with Samples), not only a Song
         Bit 6 set => Already prepared Addresses (for internal purposes)

Sequence  :  Contains all the Pattern Numbers of the Song.

Patterns  :  Contain 64 Tone Information Words each for the Channels,
               ie 64*4*4 = 1024 Bytes in 4 Voice Format,
               or 64*8*4 = 2048 Bytes in 8 Voice Format.

Samples   :  All digitised Sample Data.


NB: The file described above is stored equivalent in memory, but after
    calling SystemOn the addresses are altered and made absolute.

 Byte   Meaning
 ----   -------
   3    Tone Number (Range 1 to 8*12) . Each Octave has 12 halftones.
        Beginning with number 01 = C -3, then 02 = C# -3, and so on.
   2    Sample Number, 0 means none (or use last one).
   1    Commando/Effect Byte (Coco currently uses right Nibble only).
   0    InfoByte. Contains Values for the Command/Effect.

=  Coconizer Effects & Commands  =
==================================

&00 = Arpeggio
 01 = Slide Pitch up   (until Amis Max), Frequency+InfoByte*64
 02 = Slide Pitch down (until Amis Min), Frequency-InfoByte*64
 03 = Fine Volume up, ie louder
 04 = Fine Volume down
 05 = Slide Pitch up   (no limit), Frequency+InfoByte*16
 06 = Slide Pitch down (0 limit),  Frequency-InfoByte*16

 07 = Set Stereo Position
 08 = Start auto Fine Volume up
 09 = Start auto Fine Volume down
 0A = Start auto Pitch up
 0B = Start auto Pitch down
 0C = Set Volume
 0D = Pattern Break
 0E = Position Jump
 0F = Set Speed

 10 = Unused
 11 = Fine Slide Pitch up   (until Amis Max, f+i*64)
 12 = Fine Slide Pitch down (until Amis Max, f-i*64)
 13 = Volume up
 14 = Volume down
15-FF Unused

Please note the that difference between normal sliding and fine sliding is
that the latter happens every <speed>/50 Hz, whereas normal sliding happens
every beat (ie 1/50 Hz), that means more often and hence faster.
