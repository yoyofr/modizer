          Scream Tracker 3.20 File Formats And Mixing Info
          ================================================

This document finally containts the OFFICIAL information on s3m format
and much more. There might be some errors here, so if something seems
weird, don't just blindly believe it. Think first if it could be just
a typo or something.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the S3M file format?
What is the samplefile format?
What is the adlib instrument format?


        The first table describes the S3M header. All other blocks are
        pointer to by pointers, so in theory they could be anywhere in
        the file. However, the practical standard order is:
        - header
        - instruments in order
        - patterns in order
        - samples in order

        Next the instrument header is described. It is stored to S3M
        for each instrument and also saved to the start of all samples
        saved from ST3. Same header is also used by Advance Digiplayer.

        The third part is the description of the packed pattern format.

                          limits (like amiga does). This means that sliding
                          up stops at B#5 etc. Also affects some minor amiga
                          compatibility issues.

                          Normally volumeslide is NOT performed on first
                          frame of each row (this is according to amiga
                          playing). If this is set, volumeslide is performed
                          ALSO on the first row. This is set by default

                  the main header)
	g.v	= global volume (see next section)
	m.v	= master volume (see next section) 7 lower bits

	i.s	= initial speed (command A)
	i.t    	= initial tempo (command T)
        u.c     = ultra click removal. ST3 uses u.c gus channels to
                  guarantee, that u.c/2 channels run without any clicks.
                  If more channels are used, some clicks might appear.
                  The number displayed in ST3 order page is u.c/2
        d.p     = 252 when default channel pan positions are present
                  in the end of the header (xxx3). If !=252 ST3 doesn't
                  try to load channel pan settings.

        Channel settings (byte per channel):
          bit 8: channel enabled
        bit 0-7: channel type
                 0..7   : Left Sample Channel 1-8
                 8..15  : Right Sample Channel 1-8
                 16..31 : Adlib channels (9 melody + 5 drums)

        Channel pan settings (byte per channel):
        bit 6-7: reserved
          bit 5: 1=default pan position specified, 0=use defaults:
                 for mono 7, for stereo 3 or C.
        bit 0-3: default pan position


        Global volume directly divides the volume numbers used. So
        if the module has a note with volume 48 and master volume
        is 32, the note will be played with volume 24. This affects
        both Gravis & SoundBlasters.

        Master volume only affects the SoundBlaster. It controls
        the amount of sample multiplication (see mixing section
        of this doc). The bigger the value the bigger the output
        volume (and thus quality) will be. However if the value
        is too big, the mixer may have to clip the output to
        fit the 8 bit output stream. The default value works
        pretty well. Note that in stereo, the mastermul is
        internally multiplied by 11/8 inside the player since
        there is generally more room in the output stream.

        Order list lists the order in which to play the patterns. 255=--
        is the end of tune mark and 254=++ is just a marker that is
        skipped.

  xxxx:	sampledata

        Length / LoopBegin / LoopEnd are all 32 bit parameters although
        ST3 only support file sizes up to 64,000 bytes. Files bigger
        than that are clipped to 64,000 bytes when loaded to ST3. NOTE
        that LoopEnd points to one byte AFTER the end of the sample,
        so LoopEnd=100 means that byte 99.9999 (fixed) is the last one
        played.
        C2Spd  = Herz for middle C. ST3 only uses lower 16 bits.
        Vol    = Default volume 0..64
        Memseg = Pointer to sampledata
                 Inside a sample or S3M, MemSeg tells the parapointer to
                 the actual sampledata. In files all 24 bits are used.
                 In memory the value points to the actual sample segment
                 or Fxxx if sample is in EMS under handle xxx. In memory
                 the first memseg byte is overwritten with 0 to create
                 the dos filename terminator nul.

        C2Spd   = 'Herz' for middle C. ST3 only uses lower 16 bits.
                  Actually this is a modifier since there is no
                  clear frequency for adlib instruments. It scales
                  the note freq sent to adlib.
        D00..D0B contains the adlib instrument specs packed like this:
        modulator:                                              carrier:

        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

        Length = length of packed pattern

        Unpacked pattern is always 32 channels by 64 rows. Below
        is the unpacked format st uses for reference:
          Unpacked Internal memoryformat for patterns (not used in files):
          NOTE: each channel takes 320 bytes, rows for each channel are
                sequential, so one unpacked pattern takes 10K.
          byte 0 - Note; hi=oct, lo=note, 255=empty note,
                   254=key off (used with adlib, with samples stops smp)
          byte 1 - Instrument      ;0=..
          byte 2 - Volume          ;255=..
          byte 3 - Special command ;255=..
          byte 4 - Command info    ;

        Packed data consits of following entries:
        BYTE:what  0=end of row
                   &31=channel
                   &32=follows;  BYTE:note, BYTE:instrument
                   &64=follows;  BYTE:volume
                   &128=follows; BYTE:command, BYTE:info

        So to unpack, first read one byte. If it's zero, this row is
        done (64 rows in entire pattern). If nonzero, the channel
        this entry belongs to is in BYTE AND 31. Then if bit 32
        is set, read NOTE and INSTRUMENT (2 bytes). Then if bit
        64 is set read VOLUME (1 byte). Then if bit 128 is set
        read COMMAND and INFO (2 bytes).

        For information on commands / how st3 plays them, see the
        manual.

What is the Stmik300old format?
What is the STIMPORT file format?
What is the SIMPLEXFILE format?

        The old stmik 300 (never published because it has no
        usable interface) want's that the samples in the module
        are pre-extended for soundblaster. This means that
        samples have an extra 512 bytes of loop after their
        loopend (or silence if no loop). The save option for
        old stmik does this extension. Otherwise the fileformat
        is the same as for a normal S3M.

        STIMPORT file format is supposed to be an easy way of
        imputting weird data to st3. That is, it should be
        easy to convert something to STIMPORT format. The format
        goes like this:

          0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C   D   E   F
        ,---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---.

        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  xxxx: |Instruments...
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

        There are no patterns or orders, just a continuos note stream
        of following structures:
          0    1    2    3    4    5
        ,----+----+----+----+----+----.
        |Chan|Note|Inst|Volu|Cmnd|Info|
        `----+----+----+----+----+----'
        Chan is the channel number for the note +128. Value 0 stands
        for next row. Value 255 stands for end of note stream.
        Note/Inst/Cmnd/Info are like in the unpacked memory pattern
        (see previous section)

        After the notedata there can be instruments (optional)
        Every instrument consits of the following block:
          0    1    2    3    4
        ,----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----------...-+------...
        |Inst|Flag|LoopBeg  |LoopEnd  |Length   | Sampledata... | Name (opt)
        `----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----------...-+------...
        Inst = number of instrument to load (0=end of instruments)
        Flag = +1=loop enabled +128=name after sampledata (null terminated)
        LoopBeg/LoopEnd/Length = guess
        Sampledata = raw sampledata for Length bytes.


        SIMPLEXFORMAT is designed for easy export of notedata.
        The contents of a S3Y file is:

        32 first instruments, 128 bytes each.
          The 80 first bytes correspond to the ST3 Samplefile header
          (described in this file). The rest correspond to nothing.
        Raw notedata for the entire song - 9 channels stored.
          Every row consists of 9 notes, each consisting of 5 bytes:

What is C2SPD?
How to calculate the note frequencies like ST3?
How does ST3 mix depending on master volume?


        Finetuning (C2SPD) is actually the frequency in herz for
        the note C4. Why is it C2SPD? Well, originally in ST2
        the middle note was C2 and the name stuck. Later in ST3
        the middle note was raised to C4 for more octaves... So
        actually C2SPD should be called C4SPD...


        Table for note frequencies used by ST3:

	  note:  C    C#   D    D#   E    F    F#   G    G#   A    A#   B
	period: 1712,1616,1524,1440,1356,1280,1208,1140,1076,1016,0960,0907
	
	middle octave is 4.
	
			 8363 * 16 * ( period(NOTE) >> octave(NOTE) )
	note_st3period = --------------------------------------------
	 		 middle_c_finetunevalue(INSTRUMENT)
			 
	note_amigaperiod = note_st3period / 4
			 
	note_herz=14317056 / note_st3period

        Note that ST3 uses period values that are 4 times larger than the
        amiga to allow for extra fine slides (which are 4 times finer
        than normal fine slides).


        How ST3 mixes:

        1) volumetable is created in the following way:

        > volumetable[volume][sampledata]=volume*(sampledata-128)/64;

        NOTE: sampledata in memory is unsigned in ST3, so the -128 in the
              formula converts it so that the volumetable output is signed.

        2) postprocessing table is created with this pseudocode:

        > z=mastervol&127;
        > if(z<0x10) z=0x10;
        > c=2048*16/z;
        > a=(2048-c)/2;
        > b=a+c;
        >                     { 0                , if x < a
        > posttable[x+1024] = { (x-a)*256/(b-a)  , if a <= x < b
        >                     { 255              , if x > b

        3) mixing the samples

        output=1024
        for i=0 to number of channels
                output+=volumetable[volume*globalvolume/64][sampledata];
        next
        realoutput=posttable[output]


        This is how the mixing is done in theory. In practice it's a bit
        different for speed reasons, but the result is the same.

That's it. If there are any more questions, that's too bad :-) If you have
problems with the S3M format, try to contact somone who already supports
it (there is quite a lot of support for the S3M already, so that shouldn't
be too hard...) Good luck for reading / writing Scream Tracker files.
