3) Effects
=============

            There are a few ones... Every values are hexa-decimal.
        I do know that this is not very easy-to-use, but it allows
        you to use ALL the possibilities of the soundtracker, keeping
        a good compatibility with other formats.

        01xx    Portamento up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Increases the note's frequency. xx is the speed of
                the effect. If this parameter is null, the last
                non-null parameter will be taken.

        02xx    Portamento down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Lowers the note's frequency. xx is the speed of
                the effect.

        03xx    Tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Allows you to link 2 notes, at the xx speed. If xx = 0,
                The parameter of the last tone portamento pr‚c‚dent
                is taken.
                Example:
                        C-2 1 ....
                              ....
                        D-2 1 .306
                              .303
                              .300
                              .300
                    While D2 , because of the Tone P., the note is
                not played, but the sound mais le son increases as
                for a classical portamento . At the next line , the
                speed is changed. And at the next line,
                the speed is not null but the last parameter is taken.
                When the sounds reaches the D2 frequency, the effect
                is finished. 03xx must be repeated as many times as
                necessary, so that the link can be done.

        04xy    Vibrato
                ~~~~~~~
                    Modulates a note's frequency. x the speed (the
                bigger x is, the fastest the vibrato is) and y the
                amplitude.
                If x or y are null, the parameters of the last command
                are taken.

        05xx    Tone portamento + Vibrato
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Mix of the Tone P. and the vibrato. The parameter
                xx is for the Tone portamento. The vibrato's parameter
                is the last used. Example:
                        C-2 1 .482      Vibrato with speed 8 and amplitude 2
                              .400      The vibrato goes on
                        D-2 1 .502      Link at speed 2, the vibrato
                        goes on
                              .500      The vibrato and the link go on
                              .500

        06xy    Vibrato + Tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   Idem, but xy is the parameter for the vibrato.

        07xy    Tremolo
                ~~~~~~~
                    Modulates a note's volume. x is the speed (the
                bigger x is, the fastest the tremolo is) and y is the
                amplitude. The volume cannot be over 100. As usually,
                the parameters of the last command are taken if x or
                y are null.

        08xy    Detune
                ~~~~~~
                    Modifies a note's frequency immediately.
                        x : Fr‚quency +
                        y : Fr‚quency -
                    x et y allow you to modify of about 2/2
                tone. (-16...-8...0...+8...+15)

        09xx    Note delay
                ~~~~~~~~~~
                    Wiats during xx frames (1/50 second) before
                playing the note. If xx>speed, the note is not played.
                Example:
                        C-2 1 ....      6....   plays 3 notes of
                        length 8
                        D-2 1  902      2|4..
                        E-2 1  904      ..4|2
                              ....      ....6
                        F-2 1 ....

        0Axx    Cut note/Key off
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Cuts the note (setting the volume to 0) after
                waiting during xx frames. If an envelope was
                attributed to the sound,
                the 'Key off' part of this envelope will be executed.

        0Bxx    Jump to position
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Goes to position xx of the song. This effect was used
                by the Amiga Protracker to loop a music.

        0C0x    Set vibrato waveform
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Sets the wave form of the vibrato:
                        0       Sinuso‹d (default)
                        1       Triangular
                        2       Square

        0Dxx    Break pattern
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    The line where this effect is is the last played
                    line of the pattern. Then the music is played at
                    line xx of the pattern of the next position.

        0E0x    Set tremolo waveform
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Same as 0C0x, for the tremolo.

        0Fxx    Set global speed/Tempo
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        00 - 1F : Sets the number of frames (1/50 sec)
                                  for a pattern line. The length of a
                                  frame is re-initialised to 1/50 sec
                                  , not one more or less.
                                  The tempo is then equal to
                                  750/xx.
                        20 - FF : Tempo, the length of a frame to
                                  obtainthe correct tempo value.
                                  The error is ñ0.1 %, what is quite
                                  precise.

        10xy    Arpeggio
                ~~~~~~~~
                    Quickly transposes the note of x and y semi-tones.
                The arpeggio runs with 3frames cycles, the 1st is
                always the original note, the 2nd the note + x
                semi-tones, and the 3rd the note + y semi-tones.
                Example :

                         C-2 1 1047     C2 + 4 semi-tones : E2
                               1047     C2 + 7 semi-tones : G2
                    This effect will successively play C, E et G, to
                simulate a major C accord with strange 'gloogloos'

        11xx    Fine portamento up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Th eportamento begins at the start of line,
                instead of the start of the frame, allowing lower
                speeds than those allowed by 01xx. Null parameter :
                continue the effect

        12xx    Fine portamento down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        13xy    Roll + Volume slide
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Quickly repeats the note to simulate a 'rolling'.
                Y is the period of the rollings (in frames), and x
                the modification of the volume for each roll :
                        0       No volume change
                        1       -1
                        2       -2
                        3       -4
                        4       -8
                        5       -16
                        6       2/3 of precedent volume
                        7       1/2 of precedent volume
                        8       No change
                        9       +1
                        A       +2
                        B       +4
                        C       +8
                        D       +16
                        E       3/2 times the precedent volume
                        F       2 times the precedent volume
                Roll example:
                        C-2 1 13E3 20   Volume 20 at start, in
                        demisemiquavers
                              13E0      The volume continues
                              increasing of 3/2
                              13E0
                              13F0      Faster increase of the volume
                        C-2 1 .... FF

        14xx    Linear volume slide up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Linear modification of the volume. xx is the speed
                of increase. Null parameter : effect goes on.

        15xx    Linear volume slide down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        16xx    Exp. volume slide up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Modifies the volume exponentially at speed xx.
                The difference with linear volume increase is that the
                volume is not only increased, but multiplied, what
                gives more realistic volume increases.

        17xx   Exp. volume slide down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        18xx    Linear volume slide up + Tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    The parameter sets the volume

        19xx    Linear volume slide down + Tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        1Axx    Exp. volume slide up + Tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        1Bxx    Exp. volume slide down + Tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        1Cxx    Linear volume slide up + Vibrato
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        1Dxx    Linear volume slide down + Vibrato
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        1Exx    Exp. volume slide up + Vibrato
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        1Fxx    Exp. volume slide down + Vibrato
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        2xxx    Set linear volume
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Sets the volume of a note, linearly (from 0 to
                100).

        3xxx    Set exp. volume
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Idem, but the volume is exponantially set.
                800 correspond to 100, 700 to 80, 600 to 40,
                etc... The volume is multipied by 2 every 100.

        4xxx    Set balance
                ~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Sets the position of a note in the left-right
                stereo position. The 000 value sets the voice on the
                left, 800 in the middle (mono), and FFF on the right.
                Every value between those ones are accepted to set the
                sound anywhere in stereo.

        5xxx    Set linear master volume
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Allows you to set the general volume for every
                voices. Usually, it is equal to $3000 / (3 + number of
                voices). But as the full sound power is nearly never
                used, you can increase this level. But if
                'crackles' appear, set the value lower.

        6xxx    Set exp. master volume
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Same as the precedent, but the volume is
                exponantially set. 1000 corresponds to 1000 and 800
                to 40 (for linear values).
                The volume is divised by 2 every 155.

        7xyy    Roll
                ~~~~
                    Repeats a sample to simulate a roll.
                        x        Speed (period)
                        yy       Max. number of repeats
                    Roll must be repeated as many times as necessary.
                    If yy = 00, the number of rolls is unlimited. If
                    the speed after another roll is 0, the roll is
                    continual (so the first repetition is not
                    necessarly on the start of the note). Example :

                        C-2 1 7300 80   Plays 4 demisemiquavers
                              7000 A0   You can also increase the
                                        volume
                              7400 C0   Plays 3 semiquavers in triplets
                              7000 E0
                        C-2 1 .... FF

        8zxy    Roll + Volume slide + Set balance
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Similar to Roll + Volume slide (13xy), but the
                first number of the parameter (z) sets the new panning
                (0..8..F). Example, for a roll on toms:

                        C-3 1 8602      high Tom aigu on the left, in
                                        triplet
                              8600
                        A-2 1 8A03      medium Tom on the right,
                                        demisemiquavers
                              8A00
                        F-2 1 8C03      low Tom 100% on the right
                              8C00

        9xxx    Sample Offset
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Plays the sample from the xxx * 256 position.
                This effect is quite interresting for on one hand, it
                allows you to make subtle variations on a same sample,
                what makes the music more 'alive'. On the other hand,
                by setting little numbers as parameters, you can play
                the same instrument on 2 different voices, with the
                same note, giving the illusion that there are two
                instruments that play and not only one with a higher
                volume.

        A0xx    Linear master volume slide up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A1xx    Linear master volume slide down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A4xx    Fine linear volume slide up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A5xx    Fine linear volume slide down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A6xx    Fine linear master volume slide up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A7xx    Fine linear master volume slide down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A8xx    Set number of frames
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Changes the number of frames per note, a little
                like Set Global Speed 0Fxx, but the length of each
                frame is not changed.

        A9xx    Set fine speed

        AAxx    Pattern delay
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    The line where GT finds this effect is repeated xx
                times. The notes are only played one time at the
                beginning, but the effects still have their
                influence. It may be useful when you accelerate at a
                moment in the pattern, and you want to finish it
                correctly by compensating the number of lines.

        ABxx    Extra fine tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Tone portamento, 16 times more precise than with 03xx.

                the volume is normal during x frames, then the note
                is cut during y frames.

        B1xx    Pattern loop
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Loops a part of a pattern. A B100 sets the start
                of the loop, and B1xx sets the number of times the
                pattern will be repeated between this last instruction
                and the B100.
                    You can add loops in the loops, but you have to
                use a different voice for each loop. Otherwise, the
                loops must be 'logically' set ... Example :
                        C-2 1 B100    | E-2 1 ....      Start of the
                                       first loop

                              B103    |       ....      and 3 times
                                                        loop 1 (4 passages)

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Set the volume of a track. This volume is independant of
                the instrument, sample and envelope volumes. It is used by the

4) envelopes
============

            Many envelopes can be attributed to each instrument.
        These envelopes (there are three kinds : volume, tone and
        panning), allow you to modify the sound of an instrument
        without having to use effects in the score. For example, you
        want to apply a vibrato to an instrument, each time this one
        is played. Yes, you can do it in the score (4xx command), but
        this is boring to set for each note, and it prevents you to
        use other effects in the same time. There comes the tone
        envelope : you just have to assign a tone envelope to the
        instrument with a vibrato, and it makes it !

            But these are not the only advantages of the envelopes :
        you can change the parameters all along the sample, thanks to
        a kind of language, used to describe the envelope. Moreover,
        when a note (in the score) stops (key off), you can define a
        second envelope to describe the way the sound is cut ! Of
        course, it is possible to use the three kinds of envelopes at
        the same time.


    a) Commands for the 3 kinds of envelopes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        End             The envelopes ends here, it is not effective
            anymore, after this command. The volumes,
            periods or pannings are let as they were set
            before this command. The tremolos, tremors or
            vibrato are stopped.

        Jump to         Jumps to the specified command number.

        Wait            Waits during a number of 'ticks' before
            getting on with the commands. If increases or
            lowerings of parameters have been set, they
            will be regularly done during this wait time.


        Set Counter     Sets the loop counter to 0. You must put this
            instruction before each loop to set how many
            times the group of commands must be executed.

        Loop to         Jumps to the asked position, and substracts 1
            to the loop counter. When the counter is 0,
            there's no jump anymore.

        Key Off         When GT meets this command, the 'key off'
              part of the envelope is executed.

            An envelope must always end with a 'End' (...), a Key Off
        or a Jump (loop without end). Moreover, it must contain Waits,
        for the time is spent during the Waits, and then the sound can
        continue, for the other commands do not modify directly the
        sound.


    b) Volume envelope
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            This kind of envelope modifies everything about the volume
        of a sound : general volume, tremolo and tremor. If you have
        a volume envelope for an instrument, and volume settings in
        your score, the envelope will modify the volume so that the
        two settings are executed. It's the same thing for every
        envelope settings.
            The volume envelope is composed of a lot of commands,
        here thay are :

        Volume          Attributes a new volume to the envelope. The
            normal volume is 4000 (16384 in hexa), but it
            is possible to enter values like 7FFF.

        Vol Step        It's the step for the increasing or lowering
            of the volume.

        Vol Speed       Every xx 'ticks', the volume will be increased
              (or lowered) by the value fixed with Vol Step.

        Tremolo On      Activates the tremolo

        Tremolo Off     Desactivates the tremolo

        Trem Width      Sets the tremolo's amplitude. Be careful,
            this time the scale of the volume is from 0 to 100.

        Trem Speed      Speed of the tremolo

        Tremor On       Activates the tremor (swapping between sound on/sound cut)

        Tremor Off      Desactivates the tremor

        TremorTime1     Sets the number of 'ticks' during which the sound is
            on.

        TremorTime2     Sets the number of 'ticks' during which the
            sound is off.


            At the beginning of the envelope, in part Attack, the
        volume is initialised to 4000, the step 0, the speed 0, and
        tremor times 3.

    c) Tone envelope
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            With this kind of envelope, you can modify everything
            about the frequency of the note.

        Set Tone        Sets the period of the note. The scale is
            1000. With 2000, the note is lowered of 1
            octave, with 800 it is increased of 1 octave.


        Tone Step       Sets the step of the period variation

        Tone Speed      Sets the speed of variation

        Vibrato On      Activates the vibrato

        Vibrato Off     Desactivates the vibrato

        Vib Width       Amplitude of the vibrato

        Vib Speed       Speed of vibrato

    d) Panning envelope
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Modification of the stereo position of the instrument.

        Panning         Sets the panning: 000..800..FFF

        Pan Step        Sets the panning variation step

        Pan Speed       Sets the speed of variation

    e) Example envelope
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            The envelope language is simple, powerful, but not very
        easy to understand for beginners. So, this is an example, for
        a tone envelope :

                0   Vibrato On
                            The vibrato set 'on'
                1   Vib Width 06
                            Depth of the vibrato: 6
                2   Vib Speed 18
                            Speed of the vibrato: 18 (fast)
                3   Wait 50
                            Until now, commands 0,1 and 2 were
                        executed in the same time, in the same frame.
                        Now, the tracker stops during 50 frames (about
                        1 sec), and will execute the vibrato.

                4   Vibrato Off
                            Then you stop the vibrato.
                5   Tone Step 10
                6   Tone speed 3
                            Then we set the tone step to 10, and its
                        speed to 3. Please note that nothing has
                        happened to the sound yet. these three
                        commands were executed verrrrrry quickly.

                7   Wait 32767
                            Now, during 32767 frames (the maximum in
                        fact), the tone, set to 1000 (hexa) by
                        default, will increase of 10 every 3 frames.

                8   Jump to 7
                            Back to the precedent Wait, we have a
                        loop without end. If we only had ended by End
                        instead of Wait + Loop, the sound would not
                        have changed since the end of the vibrato and
                        the last commands wouldn't have had any
                        effect.
