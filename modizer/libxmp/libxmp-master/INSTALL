Requirements
------------

- This package needs to be built using GNU make
  (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). On BSD or SysV systems, you may
  need to use "gmake" instead of "make".


Building the library
--------------------

In most systems just execute:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

We'll build the shared library by default. Use ./configure --enable-static
to build the static library. To check if the library was correctly built,
run:

  $ make check

Use ./configure --help to see more options.


Installation
------------

To install the library and development components, just run:

# make install

as the superuser. This will install the shared and static libraries,
header file and pkg-config file into directories under /usr/local or a
different location selected with the --prefix option in configure.
