/*
 Rogue note delay test. It seems that internally, Fasttracker 2 always acts
 like the last played note is next to a note delay (EDx with x > 0) if there
 is no note. Doing exactly this is probably the easiest way to pass this test.
 This also explains Fasttracker 2â€™s behaviour if there is an instrument number
 next to such a rogue note delay, which is shown in this test. Both channels
 should play exactly the same combination of snare and bass sounds.
