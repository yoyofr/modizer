LazyUSF - A minimal Nintendo (Ultra) 64 emulator library

This library is designed for the sole purpose of playing back music files in
the USF or MINIUSF/USFLIB format. It requires a separate PSF format parser,
such as my C psflib library.

The public interface is described in usf.h. No other headers need to be
imported into any application which imports the library.
